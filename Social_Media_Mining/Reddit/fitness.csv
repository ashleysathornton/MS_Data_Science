"Bro,

You’re doing your best. I think what you need is reassurance and I’m happy to give it. You’re doing your best, you’ve lost 10KG AND you’re tracking your calories. How awesome is that? 

Now, there’s always room to improve. Do you lift bro? Pick up a program bro, start weightlifting and looking after your macros. Try hit 160G of protein or around that number, carbs and fat are interchangeable. I think 1200 is a bit low for someone who’s weighs 90KGeeees bro.

"Losing 10kg or 22lbs over a period of around 18 weeks is a perfectly reasonable rate. That's within the recommended weight loss rate of 1lb a week after you factor in initial water weight loss. 

If you don't have a lot of muscle mass, 90kg is still pretty heavy for 5'5 so just be more patient. You're doing things right in terms of diet, just keep at it.

"First of all: Good job for losing the weight. That's no small feat.


Second: Losing body fat tends to produce more visible results than simply losing mass. It's great that you've started going to the gym, as that's a step in the right direction towards changing your body composition and looking leaner.


Stay consistent with your strength training. Also, make sure to get adequate protein, as that's going to be a big factor in how much muscle you build/retain and ultimately how you look as you cut down. There's a debate on just how much you need, but based on your numbers, aiming towards a minimum of 80-100g per day seems reasonable (you can go higher - this is just a minimum).


The visual results will come - though they might be slow while you're still at a high body fat percentage. Going from, say, 15% to 14% body fat will be more visible than going from 30% to 29%.",0.2846,0.061,0.886,0.053

"Congrats on losing 10lbs! You sound keen to lose weight quickly so I thought Id help. Its common to target 2lbs of weight loss each week, so around 8lbs per month approx. This can be achieved early on but will be more difficult as you lose lots of weight. If you started March 1st then you have lost on average half a pound of fat per week over about 18 weeks, which is lower than what you should be aiming for.

It can be achieved entirely in the kitchen without stepping foot in a gym for months to come (not saying you shouldnt!), and others have given good advice about startign a lifting program.

To do this you need to:

a) understand how many calories your body needs each day and

b) accurate measure your calorie intake each day. To understand your calorie needs, use this:   [https://tdeecalculator.net/](https://tdeecalculator.net/)

I assumed you were male, 25 years old, and sedentary (your current activity in the gym is too little to increase this). Unless you are seriously training or you have a manual labour job you should leave it as sedentary.

Your basal metabolic rate is just below 2000 cals, so you will want to consume at most 1500 cals per day, every day. For reference, I was 5""10, 220lbs and I consumed 1200 cals per day when cutting...

When you measure your calories I recommend you use Myfitnesspal and weigh absolutely everything. This includes butter, sauce, oil, snacks, drinks, EVERYTHING. If it has calories and you put it in your mouth, you must include it in your daily calories. It is best to underestimate your activity level, and overestimate your calorie intake when using Myfitnesspal. If you are not doing this properly then you are consuming more calories than you think and it is the cause to your slow weight loss.

You can weigh yourself as little as once per week, or daily if you wish. Make sure you weigh in the morning, after using the loo, on accurate scales, ideally wearing little to nothing. Progress pictures or body measurements can also help you notice changes as its difficult to see them in the mirror!

You can do this, you just need to tighten up a bit. Youll see results each week if you are rigorous with the above. Good luck!

"My friend, I come from a very similar place. You are making a very good effort and are on the way of reaching your goals. However, I have learned that slow and steady does the trick. Dieting is not something you do to lose weight, it is actually a lifestyle. Dont sweat it too much if it takes some time, that is just the reality of it. Faster is usually not better when such bodily changes are concerned. I took me about two years to truly change my physique and im still not satisfied. But hey, its a marathon not a sprint. Its important that you figure out your TDEE (if you google sailrabbit you will find a good one) and eat at a reasonable deficit. At that height and weight you likely have some fat to lose and I feel you when it comes to wanting to lose it ASAP. But sometimes slower really is better.

Same thing here, turned out my calorie counting was total shit and I was over eating.  Intermittent fasting works great for me only because it gives me the mind set not to snack (and I could have easily snacked on 1,000 calories a day - and still can).

"Hey bro! Nice progress!

Based on your comments you've been at this for 4 months. KEEP IT UP!

For some context, I started on 4/15 at 122kg and today I'm 104kg. I'm 33 and 6'2"". I have a major ace up my sleeve: I formerly spent a lot of time building so I have the benefit of lean mass reactivating, and in general, lean mass consumes more calories to sustain itself. So I have some help from my past. That said, I'm going to tell you a little about what I've done and how it might adapt to you.

First up, I eat way more than you. Both in total calories and times per day. I know people swear by IF, but there is a whole other side to fitness that says you boost your metabolism by eating many smaller meals. I eat no less than 1600 calories per day, but my goal is 1760 and I typically get real close to that. I break that up into about 2 300-400 calorie meals, 2 200-300 calorie snacks, and 1 300-500 calorie big meal. I'm taller than you, which gives me a higher base TDEE, but even then, 1200-1400 seems really low and there is science to support hyper-low diets cause your body to release fat slower.

Second, a few people have identified that you may not weigh or exactly measure your food. STOP and do it right. In some cases, I'm surprised by how much or how little food is in a portion. I can only be sure when I weigh it or otherwise accurately measure. ""Eye-balling"" is terrible, except for extremely low-impact items like lettuce or broccoli. The easiest way to go wrong is with your sauces/dressings. The difference between 2tbsp and 3tbsp of salad dressing can be 60-80 calories but seem like the same amount on your plate. MEASURE MEASURE MEASURE if you want best results.

Third, make your food whenever possible. I don't care what Taco Bell's official nutrition facts say, it only takes one employee putting an extra half-squirt of fattening sauce in the wrap to make it go from 350 cal to 425 cal. That stuff adds up. Chipotle is the worst. Their nutrition facts say ""2oz"" of rice per portion, but I once got 8oz of rice in bowl (yep, I measured). When you make your food, you know what goes into it. Period.

Fourth, make sure your workouts are effective. There is a difference between doing 20 minutes of cardio at low intensity and doing 20 minutes of cardio at the right intensity. I aim to have my heart rate at least 135-145 BPM during my cardio, and I do 40 minutes of cardio per day 5 times a week.

Fifth: how is your sleep? Sleep is so critically important to weight loss and recovery. A lot of people throwaway ""get good sleep"" but don't explain how. If you have access to a smart phone or fitness tracker, install an app to track your sleep. People who are overweight are far more likely to suffer from sleep disorders including sleep apnea, and sleep disorders directly impact the production of your hormones in a way that overproduces the hormones that tell your body to store fats for later while discouraging the production of the hormones that tell your body to release stored fat when needed. Start by making sure you leave enough time to sleep, including a buffer of distraction free hour before bed with no blue light (tv, cell phone) before bed--I go on a walk and shower before bed. Then if you don't sleep well, ie: wake up rested, track your sleep with an app and go from there.

"So I'll defer to the much more knowledgable posters here but as someone who recently lost 20lbs without noticing a huge difference in physique, I will chime in with one piece of advice: improve your posture. 

It sounds too obvious or stupid but this really made a world of difference in my overall physique and allowed me to actually see the progress of my weight loss much more visibly. If you're slouched over, you're still going to look chubby. But by standing up straight with your chin up, chest up, back straight and shoulders back, you'll get a much better sense of where you're really at. And look much better aesthetically as well.

Good posture definitely takes work. Carrying some extra weight around can have some pretty negative impacts on your back and lead to some hunching but I assure you putting in the work to fix your posture is 100% worth it. There are some great exercises you can do at home for 5-10min per day that should get you on track.  


One last thing:  the stomach area is usually where fat is first stored when gaining weight and the last place left when losing weight. This can be one reason why you're failing to see much progress, as the weight you're losing is coming from other areas - maybe not quite as visible. But have some faith! You're doing an awesome job so far and 100% on the right track! It just takes some time but will be 100% worth it and even more satisfying when you reach that point. You should be super proud of your progress so far and use it to fuel you going forward.

"First, I saw an experiment where a team of scientists put a camera in a kitchen of an obese woman. She was some kind of newscaster. She thought she was fat because she had a slow metabolism. The scientists asked her to write down every calorie she ate. So she wrote down what she ate. However, when the scientists went back to look at the video, turns out that what she reported was vastly lower than what she actually was eating. So, are you absolutely  *positive* you are eating 1200 to 1400 calories?

[Here is a story about a guy that lost 56 pounds just eating at McDonalds.](https://www.niashanks.com/teacher-lost-weight-eating-mcdonalds/) He was doing it to make a point about the important thing to do is eat less calories, not necessarily the ""quality"" of the food. It's all about the calories.

So quadruple-check your caloric intake.


You say you have been doing this for months. How many months? 1 1/2? 2?

The other thing I would suggest is to bump up your cardio. I'm not sure what you are doing, but I would advise 1 hour of cardio every single day, and keep trying all the time to increase your speed. The faster you run, the more calories you will burn. It's just a fact. Once you get up to at least 6 miles per hour, and faster, the pounds will start melting away, as long as you really keep your caloric intake down. When I did this, I was losing 2-3 pounds per week. However, it wasn't linear. One week I might lose 0 pounds, then the next week I might lose 5 pounds. Even doing the same amount of exercise. That's how it goes. Lots of people will disagree with me on this, but it is the sure-fire way to lose weight fast. Keep lifting, and when you get to a body fat/weight that you like, you can cut down on  your cardio and increase your resistance training to build more muscle. But for sure jogging will slam out your body fastest, no matter what.

Intensity of exercise is also crucial. No easy slow jog, and when you lift, you should also push it (without being unsafe) and not wait around between each exercise.

"You're becoming ""skinny fat"" because you're doing your diet completely wrong:

&#x200B;

1. Your calory intake is way too low. You're not even in the ballpark.
2. You're doing cardio. You're not fit enough for cardio. If you want to lose fat tissue, only do weight training.
3. (Assumption) Your macros are completely out of balance.

&#x200B;

If you keep going like this, you're in for an ugly jojo once you stop your diet.

This is how you fix it:

&#x200B;

No more cardio!

Hit the gym 3-4 times a week, but only do full body weight training for 45-60 minutes. Stop doing cardio at all. Always have at least 48 hours of rest between workouts. So maybe you want to go Mo/We/Fr or you just go every other day. Lift heavy and fast with three sets and 6-10 reps max  (high intensity, low volume). Have at least 1 minute rest between sets.

Determine your ""Total Daily Energy Expenditure"" (TDEE).

There are TDEE calculators in the web. At 90kg and 3-4 workouts per week you'll end up with a TDEE of 2800kcal per day. To get rid of your fat tissue effectively without burning through your lean mass, you'll need at least 2300kcal every day (more on that later). So from now on, you will eat 2300kcal every single day on training days as well as rest days. Sounds a lot, but it really isn't.

Slow it down!

Weigh yourself every morning with the same clothes (or better: completely nude) after you've emptied your bladder. Track your weight. After 7 days you determine your average weight. You can only have a limited amount of fat tissue loss per week depending on your body fat percentage. Right now, you don't want to lose more than 1kg per week. If you lose more than 1kg per week, increase your calory intake slightly, since you're losing lean body mass. At 20% body fat, only lose 0,7kg per week max. At 15% only 0,5kg max and so on.

Body fat percentage is they key to know what you're doing

Do not (!) buy a scale that tracks body fat. They're not working. Use comparison pictures in the web to estimate your body fat percentage. Also buy fat calipers. They're costing around $10. Check youtube videos on how to use them or ask gym staff to do the measuring. At 20% body fat, you ""refeed"" once a week. A refeed is where you eat slightly more calories than your TDEE (which would be around 3000kcal) with high carb low fat balance (spaghetti with tomato sauce, cornflakes, rice, toast with jam or honey etc). At 15% body fat, you'll have two refeeds per week. At 10% three refeeds etc. Refeeding is done to keep your hormones in balance.

Calories and macros

You need to track them. Period. Believe me, everyone is trying to avoid this part, but there's just no other way. If you don't do this, you'll not get your body fat percentage down and you're in for some nasty jojo sooner or later due to the hormones produced by human body fat tissue. Buy a precise digital kitchen scale. They cost $10. From now on, everything you eat goes on that scale.

Use a tracking app

Tracking calories and macros is annoying. You can do the math on your own, but this is extremely frustrating and takes a lot of time. An app can do the job in seconds. I'm using ""MyFitnessPal"" which is pretty much the gold standard. They are assholes though, because even though you'll need to pay a monthly fee, they're selling all your private data to third parties. This app will really help you, though.

How to balance macros?

Macros are: Protein, Fats, Carbohydrates. Your body weight in kg x 2g = protein intake per day. In your case this is 180g proteins each day. Drink protein shakes if necessary. 5g Creatine each day is also recommended. Creatine is dirt cheap ($0,30 per daily dosage). These proteins should be 30% of your overall caloric intake. Fats should be 30-35% and all the rest are carbs. It's nearly impossible to do the calculations for an average person. So use a tracking app. The app will do the calculations for you. On refeeds, you stick with your proteins, but you reduce your fats to 50g maximum. Everything else is carbs with a target of 3000kcal. 

When to start building muscles?

Don't even think about bulking when you're above 15% body fat. I recommend you to go down 10% body fat (which means you'll have a nice sixpack and well defined muscles). Then come back and ask me again how to bulk without becoming fat in the process.

"Dude, same! A few months ago I started intermittent fasting. Started to plateau. Then I started looking into OMAD (one meal a day). I decided to try something similar. Instead of not having dinner, I eat a small salad (something I’d never do before). It’s really helped. I also stopped eating added sugars and dairy (I also don’t eat gluten because I have celiac). I’ve lost about 12 lbs in the past 2 months, but really it’s the inches that seem like a huge improvement. Here’s what my diet/schedule looks like:

I work out 5 times a week on my lunch breaks. I do push/pull/leg splits. Push 2 times a week, pull 2 times a week, legs 2 times a week. I do ten mins on stair climber with intervals. Feels like I’m dying when I stop!

I have black coffee in the morning. After working out, I drink plant based protein powder. I don’t eat until 2. That’s a healthy meal my wife has cooked Sunday. If I feel like munching on something after that, I’ll have blueberries. For dinner, I have a small salad (spinach, peas, egg, Garbanzo beans, peppers, tomato, tessamae’s avocado ranch dressing). After that, if I want dessert, I’ll have a small unsweetened applesauce or I’ll make nice cream. I bought a sorbet/soft serve machine on amazon for $20 that makes any frozen fruit into sorbet or soft serve. Best investment ever. Bananas make the best fruit ice cream. Add peanut butter or whatever else you want. I try to stop eating at 8 pm, if not 9.

And that’s it. It’s been working great for me. It’s not a fad diet. It has SERIOUSLY helped the way I look at my diet and my binging. I have a serious binging issue. I never thought I’d be able to go til 2 pm not eating, and then have salad for dinner. I’ve never had so much control over my diet and my body. I will say, I have a desk job, so I don’t have to worry much about my blood sugar dropping if I don’t eat.

Hope this helps! Feel free to ask questions. Idk if this route would work for you. I have an auto immune disease, so I can’t eat a lot of things. Either way, it may be helpful.

Don't bother with online TDEE calculators. Your current TDEE is 1800 as you are not losing or gaining weight on that amount of cals.


2. Macros look fine

3. If you use creamer you are not actually doing intermittent fasting. For weight loss it is not very consequential but you are not gaining the supposed benefits of IF.

Now the most important part. What is your goal weight at the end of it all? If it is only 5 more lbs then you can try to grind it out by reducing calories further. If it is more than that, the best thing for you to do would be to go on a diet and training break for at least 4 weeks to reverse your metabolic adaptations. Losing a really large amount of weight all in 1 go is not the best way to do it.


When you go on a caloric deficit for an extended period of time your body adapts and the overall effect is a lower TDEE. Hence you could lose weight very rapidly at the start of your diet but right now you can't lose any even though you are eating and working out the same as the start of your diet. 

I know it is really scary and hard to do but taking a break is your best option. Reverse diet back up to close to your previous maintenance calories. Still work out but with less volume than your current regime. You can sill lift 5x per week, maybe cut some sets and definitely stop say 3 reps before failure. Take it easy. This will allow your body to reset your metabolic adaptations at your new weight. However, expect to gain 2-5 lbs within the first two weeks. Don't worry it is just water and glycogen weight, not fat.

This is why IF is so powerful; because it creates a longer time with no insulin, giving a longer window for fat burning to occur. Breaking your fast reduces this.

> Is my macro spread influencing my ability to lose fat while maintaining muscle mass? 

Protein does. Protein (and calories in general) is muscle sparing, has a higher thermic effect than carbs and fats (so processing a gramm of protein burns more calories than processing a gramm of carbs would for example, although it's not a significant difference), and it's the most satiating macro nutrient. You seem to eat enough protein, so I wouldn't worry too much about it, but research doesn't show any negative side effects of protein consumption up to 5g/lb (or maybe 5g/kg, not sure, but it doesn't really matter, it's probably safe even after that amount, there is just no research to support it) unless you have kidney problems, so if you feel more protein would keep you more satiated or more compliant to sticking to your calorie limit, then feel free to bump it up while lowering carbs or fats. Determining macros based on percentages of total calorie consumption is outdated anyway.

Fasting has absolutely zero effect on fat loss.

1) If you're doing it because you think it's going to make the food you normally eat less likely to make you fat, all else constant, it probably won't do this.  I.e. there are probably no magical partitioning benefits to an IF schedule compared to not fasting and eating the same calories/macros.

2) If you're doing it because you find it better helps control your hunger and stick to a given calorie target, then this can be a viable strategy for some.

So if it's related to number 1, I wouldn't bother.  Actually log what you eat and don't worry so much about meal frequency.  It can be anything between a couple and many meals a day and probably make very little difference at the end of the day as long as your calories/etc. are otherwise the same.

If it's related to number 2, then sure, go for it.

In the end the way IF works is reducing how much you eat everyday compared to how much you spend by limiting the times you consume food. So yes, it is the same. You could potentially eat all your required calories, hitting every macro goal in one sitting and that would work.

>I think my biggest concern is I'm going to be hungry going to bed...

This is the biggest challenge with IF and takes atleast a couple of days to get used to. Like you said most people prefer evenings because of this reason. Going to bed hungry is really hard and you would end up snacking if you don't have the will. But does this limit you? I don't think so.

>I only have the mornings to eat (8:00am-noon)

"Check out the book ""The Obesity Code"" for a lot of information on this topic. (The audiobook version is solid as well.) It does go beyond reduced calories, though. 

The really short version is that, like all things, our bodies try to achieve balance. When we are eating over the course of all your waking hours then we are keeping ourselves insulin active over that time. Constant insulin makes the body try to find a way to calm it down, so we become more insulin resistant. 

Insulin resistance can be a large part of weight gain or, at least, a difficulty in losing weight. 

If we are eating within a limited window of time, we are giving our bodies some insulin inactive time to reset things and when the it realizes it doesn't have to deal with all this insulin, we start becoming more insulin sensitive. According to the author, everything after 12 hours is beneficial, which is why you see a lot of 6 or 8 hour eating windows. 

The quality of that food definitely matters, but just having that window of eating will help, It isn't like eating garbage that whole time is a good thing.

That is NOT fasting. If they weren't eating anything for those 2 days, then yeah, they'd be in a fasted state with everything it triggers. But they weren't.

"I do IF/moderate extended fasts on a weekly basis, combined with strength training, and I've lost 30+lbs in about 3 months. 

My protocols is:

Sunday - Normal day of eating healthy, typically two meals either breakfast and dinner or lunch and dinner, sometimes I'll have all three meals.

Monday - Fast from Sunday night until Monday night. Break the fast about 30-60 minutes before I go to the gym with coffee, protein powder, some Coconut oil and sometimes some additional heavy whipping cream. Lift. Eat a protein and healthy fat focused meal after lifting.

Tuesday thru Wednesday/Thursday - Fast on water, coffee, tea, electrolytes and occasional calorie-free soda.

Wednesday - Depending on the schedule for the week, sometimes will break the fast with an evening meal, focused on protein and healthy fats. If not breaking the fast, will continue until Thursday evening.

Thursday - Fast either from the night before or ongoing from Monday night until the evening. Break the fast with the coffee & protein drink previously mentioned about 30-60 minutes before gym. Lift. Eat protein and healthy fat focused meal after gym.

Friday - Fast from the night before until evening and then have a meal. Sometimes will continue the fast until post workout on Saturday in the late morning or early afternoon. Eat 2-3 times, typically whatever I might want whether its carb heavier or not.

Keep it simple and listen to your body. Your body is screaming at you that it doesn’t have what it needs. Literally. It’s shutting down to preserve your brain cells. That’s a little dramatic but kinda that’s what’s happening. 

If you wanna keep fasting, great! Hit your protein goal, stay at a deficit and adjust to see 1-2lbs weight loss a week. Drink more water. You can also use runners salts while fasting to help with the light headedness and such.

Their take was that it's obvious there's a benefit if IF helps adheres to calories, however their concern lies in terms of MPS where their stance was basically to optimize muscle synthesis the best approach for most individuals is \~4ish meals spread throughout the day of 25-40g protein. Basically that advantage would trump any fringe IF benefits.

Pre and Post workout nutrition will arguably be the most important time to time a meal. In the most basic way to describe training. You are breaking tissue down to rebuild it better and stronger. By not eating after a lift you are breaking down your body but not providing the materials it needs to build it back up stronger.

There is a lot of science that will tell you how much your body benefits from eating close to workouts.

My recommendation to you would be to drink water as soon as you wake. Eat an apple or banana before you workout. Then finish up with some low fat high quality protein (chicken breast, egg whites, tilapia) and high quality carb source (yams, brown rice, rice, cake). Follow up at work with another meal, your lunch and a snack then go to bed early.


I recently heard someone say that if you are sleeping 5 hours to get up early and do faster cardio you are stepping on dollars to get pennies (or something to that effect).

Other people really need a good breakfast, and skipping it will make them angry/hungry and prone to over eat at lunch. 

The only way you will get an answer to this is to try it. Measure your calorie intake, and then try various ways of eating so you get to the same desired calorie amount every day. Then do one week of skipping breakfast, and see how it makes you feel. If it feels easier to restrict calories that way for you, then keep doing it.

"OP,

You got some decent answers already, so venturing off a little bit...

I also tried Intermittent Fasting (16/8, 18/6, 23/1) for a while.  I didn't notice any real benefits with it alone.  I've tried different iterations and here is what I'm currently doing which I *have* found to be very helpful:

Alternate Day Fasting + Keto

Essentially I only drink water on Mon/Wed/Friday.  I eat normal sized Keto meals on Tue/Thur/Sat/Sun.  

Here is why I like this:  Fasting really ups the ketone levels and keeps you in solid ketosis.  Combining that with a keto diet on my eating days led to me having no issues staying in ketosis and continually dropping weight at a healthy pace. 

When I tried to fast for longer periods than 24 hours I found that after I stopped the fast I had increased appetite for many days after until I had mostly recovered all the weight I lost during the fast.  When I keep the fast to 24 hours my body doesn't seem to trigger the need to ""overeat"" after breaking the fast.

I also lift weights twice a week and swim twice a week, but that has remained constant so I don't consider it a variable in my testing.",0.476,0.054,0.913,0.033
"Just eat 2 normal sized meals. I try to keep mine around 600 each with about 300 cals of snacking in the middle.

Don't just eat less tho, eat better. Nuts, cheeses, and cartain lunch meats are better for snacks than crackers or popcorn. Cut out the breads, pastas, and other carbs. 

Personally I was doing OMAD for 3 days last week, then I did a 60 hour fast and adjusted to a strictly keto diet. Today I'm at the goal of my weight loss, but I think I may have lost a bit of muscle mass in the process. Now I'm planning on sticking to keto and building muscle while I try to burn through some more fat on me.

IF isn't the end all solution, but it is great for managing your body's insulin hormone system.

It may have some slight GH benifits but likely not enough to make any noticeable difference.

I believe if you want to truly benifit from the fasting benifits you likely need to have 24 hour fasts with a possible 72 hour fast here and there.

My own personality experience is that I try stick to 16/8 or 15/9 every day and eat normally but as well as I can with as little sugar or processed foods. Occasionally I'll go a day randomly on just water before beginning again with the 16/8. 

Didn't do it to lose weight, although I dropped a few inches on the waist which actually worked out nice and I  generally just feel better overall.

3 different scenarios typically happen. In all, I have black coffee in the morning, and just water while I try to stay busy at work in the morning. I very rarely get hungry before breakfast, but that’s probably the keto. 1, I eat a modest breakfast, snack, and lunch between 12-5, and after I get home and do a couple things, I practically have to make myself eat dinner and struggle to eat enough to not be in a silly deficit. Or 2, sometimes I’m busy in the afternoon at work and don’t get a chance to eat lunch, so I just eat dinner when I get home and have a nice deficit while not being hungry in the evening.

"Well I can answer this to you using my own story.

When I was about 16, I realized I didn't get hungry anymore. At breakfast, I started gagging by just looking at food, so I stopped eating breakfast.

Within a few months, I noticed the same thing happening at lunch, but not as severe.

By the time I was 18, I was eating only supper, but when I ate, it was quite a lot of food. The  difference here is that it wasn't voluntary, but rather my body's reaction to the awful diet we call normal today. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE food, but I simply can't eat much of it.

  
Fast forward to today, 5 years later, I still only eat once a day. I still keep it at supper but portions shrank. Within the last few months, I noticed I could eat only about half of what I was able to eat a year or so ago.

To set things clear, I do some really physical work quite often since I do construction very often, and I feel no side effects from working without having a meal.

&#x200B;

Now- the benefits to me are extremely limited. I am not loosing any weight. I'm slightly overweight.

It's not like I feel more energy or anything, I feel exactly the same as back when I ate 3 times a day.

About the only benefits I could think of is having the ability to eat junk food every now ad again and not having to worry too much about weight gain (as long as I don't eat it too often) and also not having to worry about making and eating food the whole damn day, saving me a lot of time in the (most appreciated in the mornings!) Of course, this approach also saves quite a bit of money ;) 

&#x200B;

Now I must add that I do multi-day hikes pretty often, and I always choose extremely difficult routes. If I go on hikes of longer than 3 days, I force myself from day one to eat instant oats for breakfast, snacks throughout the day and then supper.

Note though that autophagy is not the body using up fat stores, it is a cellular process by which waste (including proteins and cell organelles) are broken down and digested.

It has been a good mental and cognitive challenge for me with fasting and dealing with my own mood control and emotions. It's not just plain caloric deficit regimen for me anymore as it's more full mind and body awareness along with self control with mood, reactivity, and hunger management. I even challenged myself to do continuous fasting and only lasted 38 hrs before starting to become more irritable than usual. 

I will be incorporating more lifting and HIIT routines for this month since I'm getting more aware of my energy baseline while fasting.

"As usual any form of diet requires a calorie deficit if the goal is to lose fat (key word *fat* as sometimes you can lose weight but it's mostly water like the beginning of Keto for example).

As for Intermittent Fasting I loved it for the period of time I used it when I was on my last cut. I would eat from 1pm-7pm (most days I'd eat my last meal moreso around 6pm). I felt leaner overall since I'd carry less water weight (easy to show up on my lower abs) and I didn't feel as hungry.

First, I do intermission fasting to help me stick to my calorie goals. My cutting calories are 2,200 a day. Before when I would eat in the morning I would eat about 300-500cals. By 12pm I was hungry again and I found myself always overeating. By only eating between 12pm and 8pm I was able to cram the only calories I needed and maintained my goals.

Second, believe what you want but I personally do not fall for the whole ""fat burning"" side of intermittent fasting. I use it as a tool. This means that's there nothing stopping me from breaking the fast in the morning if I have too. The other day I went out for breakfast at 9am with some family. I didn't care much about breakinf the fast. In addition, this means that you simply eat the same way as you do with your macros. There isnt really anything to adjust because you are fasting.

Finally, I try to stay busy between the time I wake up and the point I break the fast at 11am or 12pm. This way I don't feel hungry! But when I do, I try to eat some almonds or snack on veggies. Some mornings I wake up super hungry. If that's the case I just eat something light maybe some oats or egg white omelette.

" Not sure how this will work for you since im a dude and IF is kinda based on personal preference but here’s a layout of how I do IF!

•Eating window: usually about an 8 hour window for me. I try to have my first meal around 12-2pm before I workout and have my last meal around 8-9pm before bed. My first meal/pre workout meal is always super light and then have a big meal after the workout and for my last meal. I have a few “snack” meals in between my 2 big meals and this sets me up for about 2,000-2,2000 calories. I’ll increase/decrease my portion sizes depending on whether I’m cutting or bulking.  And I’ve personally found that having a light pre-workout meal (banana and protein shake) is easiest on my stomach after fasting and gives me enough fuel to hit my lifts. 

•Fasting window: 12-16 hours. I’ve found this amount of time to be the most natural fasting window for me. Since I stop eating around 8-9pm I fast for about half of those hours and I’m usually not hungry in the morning, plus having busy mornings make the second half fly by. On weekends I try to have dinner a little earlier so I can break my fast earlier and have breakfast w friends. 

•IF & parting: personally I think IF works great w partying or when you’re on vacation. If I know I’m going to be drinking I’ll still IF but try to have just 2 relatively big, nutrient dense meals. It doesn’t matter if i cook those meals or go out to eat them but I tend to look for relatively healthy options and sub the carb sources for veggies if possible. It’s probably a mental game but by doing this I feel like I can let alcohol be my main carb source and take up the remaining calories... this definitely isn’t science but makes me feel better about myself 🤷‍♂️

•tips: I’ve found that having bcaa’s on deck helps tremendously with snack cravings. Caffeine helps too but I’m not a big caffeine fan but if it doesn’t bother you, a bcaa supplement w caffeine would be great to help w those cravings. If you do get hungry and can’t power through, just eat! There’s no reason to starve yourself, eventually your body will get used to it and you won’t get those cravings till around the time you choose to eat. However, fiber rich snacks are a great choice because fiber makes you feel fuller on less calories. 

Sorry for the super long post, just wanted to get you as much information as I could think of cause I struggled with a lot of the same questions! Hope this helps!",0.9969,0.165,0.791,0.045
"1) The only reason to do IF is to help you control your calories and measure more precisely by reducing the frequency of meals. The number of calories you eat is still what controls your bodymass. Do NOT go into it thinking that you will lose weight faster because of meal timing.

2) I fast for 14-16 hours a day, eat my first meal around noon, and eat my last meal around 8-9. I'd recommend you start with something like that.

3) It's much better to fast in the morning and go to bed full.

4) When you are outside of your window, do NOT snack. You will feel hungry sometimes, especially at first. Your body will adjust. You will experience the sensation of being hungry, not eating, and having the hunger recede and disappear, and you will understand more deeply the incredible and complex power of your body. It's an amazing thing. As for how to get through: Chew gum, drink a large glass of water, and go for a walk. Works for me.

5) If you want to seriously do IF--and more generally, if you want to get really lean--you will have to change your personal culture around food. You will have to learn how to go to brunch with friends and not eat, because you don't eat breakfast. The sooner you can get all your friends used to the fact that you no longer eat breakfast, the better. They will make fun of you at first, then, if you stick with it and they see your results, they will be jealous and ask how you did it.

6) Your post contains many excuses. Your body does not care about your excuses. Make feeding yourself a priority and you can have any body you want. Allow external aspects of your life to control when and what you eat, and you will struggle.

7) There is nothing to do differently as a woman. You have to try different things, different foods, different plans, and figure out what works for you and--most importantly--what you can stick to for the long term.

8) I recommend IF. It has changed my life for the better, physically and mentally. I started with /r/leangains and it was an excellent decision.

For what you might do differently, I believe women are recommended to do slightly shorter fasts 14-16 because of how it affects us (there weird technical things regarding the chemistry in our body that you can read on if you’re really curious).  

And in regards to family, I’m not sure if you’re the one who cooks or if your parents do but either way, making healthy meals (or even incorporating more healthy foods) benefits everyone imo so I don’t think you have to shy away (though again I don’t know what your personal circumstances are).

I would be careful because it's not a good diet to try to maintain over a longer period of time. Especially if you want to gain strength.

Theres also day on day off, this one was hard for me for whatever reason.  

Then i found the one meal a day idea.  Basically don’t eat all day but have a massive meal of good food on the evening. Some people prefer to have the meal midday but I prefer evenings.   

I get up go to work, drink black coffee or tea at break times and then go to the gym after work most nights. I swear its the best way to eat.  I do get run down and hungry now and again, but i work through it and then the sensation goes away. At the gym i seem to have an endless energy supply when properly fasted, its weird.  When i get home i eat almost two cups of brown rice and usually top it with stirfry veges or some other vege or curry like thing.  Some nights i eat takeout and weekends i often will eat two meals a day or one and lots of snaks and stuff.

"A lot of people mentionned good info but here are my tips to use IF

Dont get fixated on specific time. There is no difference between 15h fast or 14h30 fast.

If you are thinking a lot about food or have a craving. I usually put a timer and if 10-20 sometimes 30 mins later I still want it. Ill eat it.

Last quick tip. Dont aim for crazy drops as the more you get into a deficit the more you will experience cravings and gain the weight back afterwards. Slow steady progress. Example im cutting weight right now 191 to 175 in about 16 weeks.

Changing habits slowly>massive weight drops in long term

">I'm working on building muscle, as well as cutting fat, so I've been --trying-- to eat at a maintenance level of macros, roughly 1700.

You have to eat healthy fat just so you feel satisfied and don't feel hunger. Cutting out fat will make fasting difficult. It takes a couple of weeks. I have been on intermittent fasting for years and I fast for 23 hours. I eat between 4 and 5 pm. I work out every morning from 6:30 to 8:30 and don't feel fatigue and get a good pump. Lots energy throughout the day.,0.8783,0.211,0.756,0.034
"Seems like you've had some good answers, but I'll go ahead and add mine as well:

I do a 6 hour eating window from about 2:30 in the afternoon to 8:30 in the evening. I'm not super strict about it; sometimes it's more like a 7 or 8 hour window, but most days I'm pretty close. Eating mostly consists of two big meals, one at the start of the window and one at the end. I'll also sometimes eat a snack in between. In the morning I like to drink coffee and get going on work rather than worry about food, so that window seems to fit nicely. I also find I sleep better if I don't eat at night, so 8:30 is a nice stopping time as well.

I work out (powerlifting) right before I eat, so I'm doing it at the very end of the 18 hour fasting window. It felt kind of weird at first, but after a while I like it better than lifting after eating by far. I recently starting taking BCAAs right before the workout, and while I don't think it makes a huge difference, I do think I feel a little more energetic.

Food-wise I find it much easier to eat well doing the intermittent fasting. When you're eating because you're hungry you tend to crave real food, and when you're eating because you're bored you tend to want junk. I eat rice, meat, vegetables, eggs, guacamole, fruit, nuts, and dairy (cottage cheese mostly). I've pretty much cut out refined sugar completely.

I'm a guy, but I've had a couple female friends tell me that the fasting gets rough in the days leading up to their period. Just relax the fasting protocol for those few days and then get back to it.

I'm not very strict about it when I'm going out. If I'm going somewhere with friends for a couple days I'll usually just skip breakfast and drink coffee, and then eat a normal lunch and dinner. I also don't worry too much about drinking alcohol outside the window, but I'm not a heavy drinker so it's not a huge thing either way.

Personally, I find that I *prefer* doing IF to not. I certainly feel much better vs. constantly eating all day, but even beyond that it's just less effort spent worrying about food. Also my lifts have gone up for the first time in a while, and that's hugely motivating. I think it's important to stick with it long enough for it to become routine, but also not get religious about it and remain flexible.

Good luck, hope it works for you.

"I've been using IF to help control calorie intake for 7 months now and I can agree with other people who are saying you're over thinking this. 

1) You're going to struggle to loose fat if you eat at maintenance. I'd suggest eating at a deficit so you don't drag this on for years. 

2) Just skip breakfast and don't eat after 8PM. 

3) If noon to 8 doesn't work for you, pick an 8 hour window that does. Don't over think it. And if you eat at 9 one day because of your schedule, the world doesn't stop spinning. I've eaten lunch at 11 or 2 and eaten after 8. Worry about being roughly right. 

4) Discipline. You need to want the results more than you want to open the fridge. It's hard at the beginning but I can say that 7 months into this, it's really second nature now. You will eat when you're not supposed to, but it's not the end of the world. You just get back at it the next day. Just keep at it and it will get easier. 

5) Don't know

6) There's always an excuse on why you can't IF or have to break your eating plan. I have 2 active kids and we end up grabbing food out a lot on to get kids to practices, etc, but I still make sure to hit my macros and IF. ",0.8795,0.086,0.879,0.035

The most difficult part is eating enough during your feeding window to hit your macros, especially if you want to gain muscle. Nuts will become your best friend.

To be technical it might even slow weight loss down but likely not enough to even remote notice. Fat loss will be pretty consistant either way.

The reason is IF has some small(very small but still there) increase of Growth hormone and cellular regrowth which may slow the amount of muscle loss during your deficit.

Of course that would be a benifit to some which is why some promote it.

Fat loss will likely be the same. Although some argue the GH will help promote fat loss too. I've yet to see any evidence.

At the end of the day if you want to lose weight, stay in deficit. There may be slight advantages in things like hormone regulation and cellular regrowth but at the end of the day it won't make a difference for fat loss.

There are also some potential health benefits of taking breaks from eating, giving your digestive system and body a break from digesting food so that it can focus more on the postpradial period. This is especially true of your metabolic energy system. Not eating allows your body to burn down its glycogen and go through cycles of using more fat for fuel as your glucose reserves deplete. Then when you refeed it rebuilds your reserves. This is what your body was built to do and the modern day culture of constantly eating (especially carbs) has broken this natural cycle.

"Hey!

So in my fitness journey over the past two years, having tried a few different things, IF included, what I've come to learn having gotten a S&C/nutrition coach monthly for 10 months is the following;

the main thing to remember about IF is that the reason most people lose weight is because the IF directly impacts food intake (sounds obvious, but what I mean is that it translates to a calorie deficit). Less eating time per day generally equates to less calories consumed.

Your macro breakdown and your 3060 calories per day is the main thing that matters. You could eat them in one sitting, or you could eat it spread out every hour over the day. The calorie deficit is the main thing. It becomes more complicated when trying to put on lean mass, or aiming for specific things. But for fat loss it's perfect...
Google Brad Schoenfeld, Mike Israetel or Steve Hall for more info.

Not trying to take away from IF if it works for you or others, just something to bear in mind - it's not a magic pill that helps you lose weight, but a way to aid the calorie deficit and fat loss. Fasting states, keto states etc., are all secondary. The pillar of weightloss the calorie deficit.

I've found it extremely hard to eat enough protein to repair muscle, so had to supplement diet. But general diet has been:

Workout -> Eat meal consisting of a protein (i.e. chicken breast, an entire bag of greens, and a half container of fruit or a whole apple or something). Then an hour or two later make whey shake in ~2 cups of whole milk. I've stayed *very* satiated doing this and have been losing 1 - 2 lbs/week. Have built a bit of muscle too but not at a crazy clip.

According to [Dr. Satchin Panda](https://www.salk.edu/scientist/satchidananda-panda/) consumption of *anything* other than water, including coffee (no specification of caffeinated or not) will have an impact which you could interpret as *breaking* a fast. Link and key quote follow.

[https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2)

“When we drink coffee, is it going to trigger metabolism or certain things in our gut so that the gut will think, ""Well, now I have to start working, the rest is over”? And we think that’s where the metabolism or the function of the gut to absorb, or digest this coffee, send that caffeine to liver, and then to brain does kick start right after we drink coffee. Because that’s how we are feeling the effect of coffee in the rest our body, because the stomach started working, it absorbed coffee, it sent it to liver, liver might have metabolized it slightly and started to send it to the rest of the brain and body. And then it gets back to kidney, it gets metabolized and excreted. So then the question is, forget about circadian clock, now if we think about just metabolism and, say, mitochondria function, or even, say, go back to autophagy, and then ask, “Is caffeine breaking the fasting so that it stops autophagy, or it stops something else? Or is there a crosstalk between, say, caffeine receptor and glucagon receptor so that it does?” No, fasting is kind of slightly over. You may not be in 100% fast, but in 40% or 50% fast. So that’s where things become murky, so that’s why we say, “Well, if you can, drink your coffee within this 8-hour, 10-hour, it’s better.” But at the same time we know, going back to the study that we discussed, Ruth Patterson study, they did not consider coffee as food. So when they considered 13 hours overnight fasting, that 13 hours actually included coffee and tea. So in that we know for cancer, reducing breast cancer risk, this 13 hours of fasting can include coffee, black coffee, and tea. So this is where things are really murky. And we tend to error on the safe side, so we tell, well, if you can have that coffee within your eating window, that’s much better. If you can’t, then just have black coffee. At least that will not trigger your insulin response or glucose response. So that’s what we do, we recommend. Rhonda: Just sort of as a side note because you mentioned it, I recently spoke with Dr. Guido Kroemer, who is an expert on autophagy, and he was telling me about a study he had published a few years ago where the specific polyphenols in coffee, decaf or caffeinated… So irrespective of caffeine, it’s just it’s the polyphenols. Satchin: Yeah. Rhonda: They triggered protein de-acidulation, which is one of the triggers for autophagy. So it actually increased autophagy. Satchin: Increased autophagy, yeah. So that’s why we never know, because coffee, or any natural compound, has so many different ingredients that we don’t know the activity.""

The science from the books seems to state that this routine well help you lean out without losing too much muscle mass, but it does lower your basal metabolic rate a fairly substantial amount so even the maintenance is 1000 calories every other day as opposed to going back to eating normally.

For me I can do the routine for about six to nine months with a weight loss of roughly 7 and 1/2 pounds a month, then I hit a willpower depletion wall.

"Mostly, I noticed I was less stressed about timing my workouts and meals.  

Most people don't know this, but I actually invented the 16/8 approach back in high school in the 90s.  If only I had known this one weird trick was something so many people would pay to learn about.  

Nearly ten years ago I got turned on to *Eat.Stop.Eat.* and started doing two, 24-hour fasts during the week.  I credit this book with starting me on an 'evidence-based' path with respect to fitness.  About this time Leangains was taking off as was the Warrior Diet.  I thought I had found my people.

But that evidence based path eventually led me to the uncomfortable conclusion that my self-diagnosed condition of being a 'hard gainer' was actually the obvious result of me not eating enough.  And you know what, purposely not eating wasn't helping that issue.  

So I stopped.  And the only thing that changed is I started growing.  Yes, yes, I know you can gain weight doing IF or OMAD or whatever.  But for me, trying to stuff my face in a condensed time window was not the best thing for me.  And, on top of that, trying to find a time in my week where a prolonged period of not eating that wouldn't affect my workouts was more of a hassle than actually working out.  So I stopped.  

Meanwhile other evidence started emerging that spreading your calorie/protein intake across the day is beneficial for gains and lean mass, so instead of outright skipping breakfast I now have at least a scoop of whey in the morning.  

I know there are benefits to pure fasting that are distinct from calorie-matched, 'normal' diets.  But, personally, those benefits are not out-weighed by the benefits that come from more continuous eating.  Not to mention the social elements that arise when it's 10:36am and you can't have the [whatever] because you've arbitrarily decided you can't eat anything until 12:30pm.  ",0.9791,0.134,0.802,0.064

I've adapted to it to the point that I don't really feel hungry at all anymore. I might get hunger pains or get a little loopy if I get close to 20 hours or so, but it's very minimal, really. I could ignore it if I wanted.

I do drink protein shakes in the morning (casein) and for lunch (whatever is in the 40g shakes at convenience stores), but that's like 400 calories total and basically no carbs, so I don't think it counts.

What I mean by ""on average"" is that I'd take a day of just protein shakes if I was deviating well above my set point weight because of binging on a huge meal the night before, so I stayed at about the same place for the entire time.

Now I'm finally tracking calories and losing pretty rapidly.

I think I'll probably keep doing it most days even after I hit my goals, mostly because I like to eat dirty and IF is a way I can maintain my physique while endulging myself a bit. It's basically ""cost free"" to me at this point, since I've become so well adapted to it.",0.5548,0.102,0.812,0.086

Your workout hours will depend on what your body needs. Some people can lift first thing in the morning without any food. Others prefer to have a meal in and work out a few hours later in the evening. Since you're dieting, no matter what you do you'll probably always feel at least a little low energy. Choose the time period where your body feels most active/able to lift. 


Macros should still factor in. I've found that protein is more important on a cut than bulk if you want to retain muscle mass. I run by at least 1g/lb during a cut, and go with at least 1g/ lean body mass (total mass - body fat) on a bulk. If you just want to lose weight without as much concern for your ""tone"", macros don't matter
much. As for calories, don't go overboard. It's still a cut. 


IF worked well for me. I dropped from 180 to 150  (e: ~17% BF to ~11% BF) over the course of 4.5 months, going a bit slow to make sure that I retained as much muscle mass as possible. However, IF worked well for me because I loved huge meals, and could time my workouts around them. It's not necessarily any better than regular dieting in terms of calorie loss. You'll still feel hunger pangs and low energy throughout chunks of the day. 

If the reason you're choosing IF is because constantly eating tiny, unsatisfying meals grates on your soul, go right ahead. If it's because you think it might be some secret super easy weight loss method, you might want to reconsider.

"Hi, I’ve done a period of intermittent fasting and it’s usually different for everyone, the mantra of fitness diets and exercise it seems. But I can give you my opinion of the questions you have in hopes of it helping you.

1. If you simply can not function without coffee to kickstart your day, I would recommend going with black. Adding any milk, whether it’s so or other types will not be faithful to the true intermittent method. Same with the zero calorie sweeteners. Tea may be a better alternative, but I don’t drink coffee enough to know about this answer.

2. If you think your body can handle not having fuel for a workout before your feasting period, I wouldn’t recommend working out beforehand. People, including myself, can workout with little to no fuel (I don’t eat breakfast) so they can get through it. However, if this doesn’t sound like you, workout after your first feasting period, so you can eat what your diet or preference is for your next feasting period. Remember, the window of intake is one of the primary focuses.

3. I never counted calories or macros when I did it, so this is your preference. You’ll get hungry as shit though if you don’t eat enough to get through the 16 hour window and this will dismantle the purpose of intermittent fasting.

4. When I did this process, I used thermogenics and apple cider vinegar to curb my appetite. If you can are worried about eating too many calories, you could do this, but the point is to EAT during your feast window. I saw the results I needed to and got more cut because of it, which was my goal.

"Intermittent fasting is a trend, and there's a lot of broscience going on. Muslims have been doing intermittent fasting for Ramadan for centuries, though for religious reasons obviously. Metabolically it doesn't sound so smart, because when the body is getting empty on it's blood sugar reserves glykogen, it starts breaking down muscle to make blood sugar. It takes a day or so before the body starts breaking down fat into ketones for energy. So logically intermittent fasting should not break down fat but only muscle.

The first two months were great. I lose weights and gained muscles real quick. But after these two months, I started to have a hard time recovering from my sore muscles. I started to have an acid stomach and feel generally tired.

Eventually I was too tired to continue my training. Later I discovered that the fasting after all these hard sessions flushed the good nutriments and minerals from my body. I ended up with carences and had to get prescription for nutritional supplements.

"I think it all depends on the person and their lifestyle? I'm definitely not into the whole, must eat 6 small meals a day consisting of chicken breasts and broccoli. No. When I eat I want to eat A LOT of food. I love intermittent fasting, cause I'm never really hungry in the morning. All I need is a black coffee, or a coffee with some almond milk and I'm good to rock and roll. The thing about eating in the morning for me is that I either never feel like it, or I eat and I feel like I'm ready to go back to bed - and who wants to ""make something"" in the morning, eat it, then rush out the door on a full stomach? That's just not comfortable for me. 

Instead, I find that not having to worry about eating or forcing myself to eat when my body is not even hungry is great in terms of productivity and my focus. I can concentrate on work, working out on an empty stomach. I even lift while fasted. I don't think it has affected me at all. And I really don't think I can accomplish the same when I'm fed, cause imagine doing a HIIT workout when you just ate...no please. 

And it just so happens the perks of fasted workouts are easily attainable when you have an eating schedule that's IF (16 hours fasted / 8 hours feeding window) just think about your human growth hormone, and insulin levels. 

I also find intermittent fasting to be great from a time saving perspective too, instead of having to sit down 3 times a day and depends on you, maybe that'll take an hour for all 3 - you can sit down for 2 meals instead for 30 minutes. And of course you can eat more for 2 meals instead of splitting everything up into 3. 

Also another strange thing I found about intermittent fasting is that I'm also hungry a lot less on IF than if I'm off - say if I actually have a breakfast of oatmeal + almond milk with nuts and fruits, I notice that I'll be really full from morning but then from noon I'll definitely be hungry again (yeah even though oatmeal is not supposed to trigger that much of an insulin response, this gets worse the more refined breakfasts I have ie: think about having cake or donut for breakfast, yikes.) on IF I gradually get hungry but I'm usually fine until 1 ~ 2 pm and then I go find something to eat.

Only after that I started to do it more seriously in order to get in shape. I started to eat more vegetables, lowered my carbs as much as possible, avoiding sugar whenever I can and lastly, I haven’t drunk any soft drink/juice these past months. Never even tried alcohol either so that hasn’t been a problem to me.

So far the only things that bothered me were how hungry I sometimes got in the beginning and that how oftenly I’d overeat because of my ”only two meals” mentality. Another problem that I had was that at least once a week I would want to eat food like burgers and pizzas. There’s nothing wrong about eating these food (I’ve eaten these now and then as well) but you’ll reach your goal much slower if you aren’t careful.

Now, the benefits I’ve gotten from IF these past 5 months are weight loss, muscle gain, more focused throughout the day, no sugar cravings, more disciplined (if you want to count this one) and being more knowledgeable about healthy lifestyle in general. I’m not saying that I could answer everything scientifically about the topic but I could give advices here and there. I’ve started to eat more healthier and added HIIT workouts in my weekly routine too which are huge reasons to why I’m not tired and I’m able to focus on my tasks.

This is true. During a fast, you can really only have zero-calorie beverages like water, unsweetened tea, and black coffee.

The point of IF is not to follow a regimented eating schedule but to experience satiety despite limited calories. That is to say, if you can eat 1,500 calories/day, two 750-calorie meals will be more satisfying than three 500-calorie meals for most people.",0.949,0.102,0.845,0.053

I haven't died yet and I can make it through my workouts pretty fine. Some people prefer to train closer to when they break their fast, say train at 10, then immediately go break the fast at 12. Experiment see how your body responds.

IF does help most people look a bit leaner, due to the fact that on starting most people actually eat less calories than they need to. It's hard to go from getting all your daily calories in a 12-13 hour window to getting it all in an 8-hour window. So actually they're eating in a deficit without really planning to. And also they just have less food/water/air in their system during the first part of the day since they usually skip breakfast and go right through till lunch. But losing body fat comes down to eating in a caloric deficit.

If you want to lose body fat you'll have to eat in a deficit at some point. Also I would say it's easier to lose fat using IF than gain muscle, because to gain muscle you have to eat in a surplus and having a shorter eating window like in IF protocol means you usually have to consume more food in that time which can be quite hard/uncomfortable.

However, you're a beginner, now starting the gym. I would advise that no matter the eating protocol you follow; IF, keto, 3 meals, 6 meals whatever, eat at maintenance for the first few months, 2-3 months just to see how your body responds to the lifting. Just go and lift, with good form, train with intensity, get in enough volume, some cardio once or twice a week. That should be your focus. Your body will change since it's being pushed into something new it hasn't done before. Plus you'll be benefiting from those newbie gains too.

"Nothing is ever good for ""everyone"". There is a lot of variance in the lifestyles and genetics of the population. If it is working, stick with it.

I wouldn't be overly concerned with efficiency. Fitness has a lot of diminishing returns to the effort you put in. If you aim to lose 50 pounds, most of that weight loss will be front loaded, because you are carrying an extra 50 pounds on you down and simply walking around burns more calories. The last couple of pounds will come off the slowest and you have to be far more strict about sticking to your nutrition plan than at the beginning. The same is true for muscle gain. An untrained guy can gain muscle mass very quickly (i.e. 20 pounds in year 1) while an advanced lifter will have to do things perfectly and can only gain a few pounds a year.

I don't think you will be too upset if you lost 45 pounds in 6 months instead of 47 because you used a slightly less efficient method, because you will lose the remaining weight over the next few weeks anyways. It's all about consistency and the ease of consistency for your lifestyle. It would really suck to lose the weight and then gain it back because it is too hard to stick to the plan.

Interesting read. I have been intermittent fasting the last few weeks or so. I have seen great benefits to the fasting. I was always someone who bought into the eating breakfast as early as possible.

It's not IF by any means but I realized I was losing the same amount of weight as I was on IF because it's all based on activity + calories. IF is nothing more than a tool to help you stick to a diet, aka an eating window. It's nothing I can realistically do for the rest of my life because of social events and I just felt like it shouldn't be something I look forward to (eating). I would binge eat at times on IF too.

"32M 6'3"" 205lb. 

Major medical issues at 26 yo caused me to totally change my lifestyle with a focus on health, mobility and overall wellness.

I've been on a similar schedule to what you describe for the last year. Training consistently for the last 5 years.

I usually eat dinner around 6pm. Black coffee in the morning, sometimes creamer, I'm weak there I'll admit, but usually black - before my work out. I'll often take BCAAs 20-30 min prior to work out. Other than coffee/BCAA I don't eat before work out. My body doesn't respond well and knowing that about myself was a huge game changer for me.

I'll gym it up around 7:30-9:30a and have a shake after, usually 9:30-10a. Some days I'll have a small snack - banana or Costco protein bars lol - mid day but usually just hold off until dinner for anything more than that.

I do add creatine to my shakes but that and BCAAs are it 

I make a point to eat dinners consisting of nutrient dense whole foods. I am mindful of eating as fuel and being sure I have a good nutritional plan. I have annual blood work done that is consistently golden.

5 years ago I was 280lbs and unknown body fat % but I was chubby fit. Never obese, but chubby fit for sure.

I'm down to a pretty damn lean 205lbs and maintaining it comfortably. I wish I'd found out how well intermittent fasting works for me years ago. :)

Throughout the process I have continued to add lean muscle with no problems. I'm not out to be the bulkiest guy. I'm big enough as it is. I don't need to buy a new wardrobe haha. But I've definitely become more muscular. No problem there.

Edited a couple times lol, also want to add that I never feel low energy EXCEPT for some days at the 4:30-5pm hour when I start thinking about what I'm having for dinner. That mental game seems to increase my ""hitting the wall"" until after I eat sometimes. Otherwise am hands down more energetic than ever before!

 I now eat whatever I want throughout the day, as long as it's within my calorie bucket - and my mood is a lot better and my workouts are much much better when not fasted.

If you feel you aren't losing much muscle then it is most certainly a method you can use. The way to test this is to continue a good weight routine with a focus on strength (5 rep range) 

Your fasted state will be detrimental to your gym performance in terms of volume, but if your strength output remains static or only slowly declines then you are maintaining muscle.

Your muscles may look smaller however they have just lost their glycogen stores, and still have the capacity for strength work.

Really dont see a reason why it wouldnt work. Also if u trigger Insulin at the right times, not every 2 hours, ur fat gains will be very low. Yet the muscles will get their nutrients if u allow a high insulin reaction after training. Since u are less resistant to Insulin, the absorbtion will be even greater.

I'm pretty sure the wiki has some things to say about this already but here goes...

Intermittent fasting is just a way to manipulate your calorie intake throughout the day that might make it easier for some to meet their calorie goals. Generally though, it's for people who are looking to lose weight that want a structured time to eat their meals.

If you are looking to gain muscle and you are not ""fat"", then Intermittent fasting probably isn't for you. I can't really vouch for it because I personally don't believe that I can stick with it long term, and find it better to just adjust my meal contents to fit my needs.",0.9463,0.16,0.803,0.037
"I've been in 16:8 for a few months. Mentally, I'm more productive at work than ever. I feel sharp and have endless focus and motivation until I break fast around 1. The first month, after breaking fast, I would find that I lost most of those benefits for the next few hours at work but now I cruise through lunch. Might be because I'm lifting and running more this year. 

I find it very easy to still gain weight. Just have a couple of decent sized meals per day plus a whole milk protein shake at some point depending on when I workout. Dinner is usually bigger than lunch. 

I haven't found it effects how I lose or gain fat. Going sugar free essentially made it impossible for me to keep fat on but fasting doesn't really seem to make a difference. If you eat ice cream for only 8 hours a day, you're still eating ice cream everyday. 

I highly enjoy fasted running with a couple of ""Gu's"". Fasted dead lifts, not so much. I really enjoy the eating schedule overall and I like that I feel full after my meals because I'm quite the eater. ",0.9723,0.162,0.775,0.062

"I've done 16/8 intermittent fasting for years (eat only during 8 hour window each day). The benefit is simple: it allows me to limit my calories while still eating big meals that satiate me. The alternative is to eat throughout the day like fat people do, but eat smaller meals each time. That works for some people, not for me.

Not eating breakfast also fits my daily routine. I can't be bothered with food in the morning. Preparing two meals a day is enough. Eating dinner straight after work is also great. I enjoy sitting down for dinner with my wife. It's an important part of the day for me. Makes me feel great.

"When you are looking to lose weight the main point is that you are decreasing the calories that you consume. However you manage to do that is a personal choice because not everyone is the same. A lot of people like intermittent fasting because it suits them to be honest. It works because most people will find it really hard to eat a large amount of calories in a short period of time. If you are trying to put on muscle mass intermittent fasting is not the best method, its actually terrible to be honest. 

In terms of testosterone I would say it would only increase test if you are overweight, if you are not over weight and skinny I would say a decease in testosterone levels would be more likely. You have to remember that when your body only cares about survival if your not getting enough calories in you sex life will go out the window because that is not needed to survive, hence a decrease in testosterone.

>Can i increase muscle mass and also fast?

Yes, but barely while cutting, which is the same as with any diet/calorie restriction.

>Will fasting increase or decrease your strength and size?

May actually be beneficial, unless you train fasted. You are able to eat a bigger meal before the workout, giving your more energy and increased intensity.

>It seems wrong to be alternating binging and fasting, but is that a good idea?

Binging and fasting every day or for longer periods like cutting and bulking? If the first, then it doesn't matter. If the second, at least go for 2 weeks of binging and 2 weeks of fasting. Studies have shown that this may increase gained muscle mass, but further research is needed.

"It works, but so do all other diets that put you in a chaotic deficit. I think the reason it became popular is because it made people realize that the claim that you should be eating 6+ small meals a day to ""boost your metabolism"" was a total myth. 

Personally I don't do IF because with carbs being moderate to high in my diet, forcing myself to fit them all in within a small window makes me crash very hard. I have to spread them throughout the day instead in order to function properly. ",-0.4478,0.101,0.77,0.129
Ive been doing IF about a month. Lost almost 5 lbs while keeping all of my muscle. My energy and strength have both improved. The mental clarity is great as well.

"Eat stop eat by Brad Pilon is a great little book on the subject. Edit. I should say that it's main benefit is that the body produces more growth hormone when fasting.

A good argument I've heard for it is that there are different chemical reactions happening in the body when we are hungry and we dont experience them anymore the way we did when we evolved. It's good to have them sometimes ,0.5106,0.128,0.817,0.055

"I'm doing IF through skipping breakfast on weekdays.

The results are great -- I started by loosing 2lbs/wk.  Now that I've lost 20lbs and I'm closer to my target weight, I'm loosing 1lb/wk (10lbs to go).

Best part: No calorie counting.  Yet I end up eating less.

I focus on getting meals that are high in vegetables and proteins and reduce simple carbs and sugar.  I also drink a lot of water instead of eating in the morning.  I have coffee with cream and no sugar.  I tend to eat lots of bad foods (e.g. pizza & beer) on the weekend, but get back on the program again through the week.

Overall, I'm happy with the approach as it's something I can sustain without a lot of effort.  I've done calorie counting in the past (it worked) but I hated doing it.

"For the majority of the population, they seem to think it's a ""diet"" when in reality it's an eating protocol. Did it on and off for years.. Based on what current research says, it's better to get most of your calories/protein in 3-4 meals during the day from a LBM preservation standpoint. ",0.4404,0.056,0.944,0.0
"I used it for my cut during 2012 which I got from 82kgs to 70.5kgs in around 10 weeks. I think I went from around 20% bodyfat to around 12% and it was really easy for me.

It didn't really blunt my hunger but I still felt it was managable since you kinda got used to not eating if you understand what I mean by that.

Like after the first few weeks sure I was hungry after 12 hours but I had no problem waiting another 4 before I could eat. Also I wasn't that super duper strict with my schedule, some days if it was easier for me I ate during a 12 hour window instead of a 16 hour.

I would advise, as a general rule, not to add stress on top of stress. 

If you're concerned about a lack of sleep, then being well fed is ideal.  Very small cut would be better than the deeper cut you're probably going to be able to do with IF.",0.8712,0.213,0.702,0.084
"I did it sleeping on logs and leaves in the Amazon for about a week, eating about 400-500 calories total across those 7 days. My sleep was pretty interrupted because my ""bed"" was pretty uncomfortable, not to mention being woken up by the occasional giant armadillo. Even without typical resistance training, I lost very little muscle, and was back to pre-trip in about a week or two. 

I don't think the sleep schedule makes a big difference, but sleep makes it easier to keep the fast going longer.",0.6369,0.105,0.838,0.057
I don't think it's a great idea to just try out intermittent fasting while you're deployed anyway. IF doesn't make you lose fat or gain muscle better than any other caloric deficit. ,0.3744,0.216,0.632,0.152
