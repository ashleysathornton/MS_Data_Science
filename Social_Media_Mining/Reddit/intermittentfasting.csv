You're sending the message that with 11 months of hard work that you can go from flabby to ripped. I, personally, fell for one of these posts. I can't even express the frustration I felt after 18 months of hard work and not seeing results anywhere close to these. I ended up coming to the conclusion that it was simply impossible for my body, and I quit.

So I have posts like yours to thank for that loss of time and lack of progress.

Later I took the time to actually study nutrition and body building and learned exactly what posts like yours are: **a lie**. This isn't /r/brogress. This isn't /r/bodybuilding. It's intermittent fasting. These people, by and large, don't know how to see the signs of a bulk/cut. You're telling them that it's possible to get this with a year of work and it simply isn't.

They'll try to replicate your results and give up.

The least you could do when posting this in a dieting sub is immediately make a comment at the top level letting people know that you trained regularly as a college line backer for years before IF burned the fat off your already sculpted physique.",0.25,0.089,0.826,0.085

"If you‚Äôre already lean and you don‚Äôt want to lose anymore fat but rather build lean muscle then yes you should focus more on strength training rather than cardio. 

If you enjoy cycling then you don‚Äôt need to cut it out. You would have to increase the amount of calories and protein you intake to make sure your body is building and repairing muscle. 

If you want faster results I suggest getting a gym membership instead of working out at home with weight  training. As you make progress you have to keep increasing the weight you lift, it your dumbbells only go up to 30 lbs then you‚Äôre limiting yourself. 

A gym would also give you the benefit of a wide variety of machines and free weights to hit your muscle from different angles and exercises.",0.9825,0.21,0.753,0.037

"I could use some help.

I got a Peloton about 6 months ago, lost about 30 pounds. Got down to 155.

Naturally I started seeing abs and muscles. So I started doing Peloton Strength training too. This is 20-30 min workouts 5 days a week.

Then I added core workouts, which are 10 mins long, 5 days a week.

Then I began reading and realized I need a bunch of protein.

Then I started getting 5grams of creatine per day.

Now I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm doing too much cardio (I try to ride 5 days a week) and maybe I‚Äôm not doing enough strength. Maybe I need to prioritize strength over cardio?

I‚Äôm not sure if I should be trying to gain weight - I don‚Äôt really want to. But I would like to look ripped like Brad Pitt in Fight Club. I‚Äôm not trying to look like the Rock.

Anyway, I‚Äôm finding this all to be quite complicated. I‚Äôm very fit looking right now but I‚Äôd love more muscles.

My thought is perhaps just increase the amount of time I‚Äôm doing strength and do less cycling?

All I have at home is dumbbells. Was thinking of getting a pull up bar. No room for a bench press.

Anyone got any suggestions?",0.939,0.144,0.774,0.082

But would say this is not typical for the overweight couch potatoes (like me) that stumble across IF and give it a go.

"Congrats, man. Amazing transformation. I started my weight loss journey about two years ago, and I made a ton of progress doing the exact same thing you did every Sunday. 

I stopped doing my fast Sundays around the time I started lifting because I was paranoid about going a whole day without any protein. Instead, I just try to just keep the calories low, with only protein based items every Sunday. At least, that‚Äôs the idea, but it‚Äôs weird, but once I eat just one thing, it always just starts a spiral of compromises until my ‚Äúlow calorie Sunday‚Äù basically just becomes a ‚Äúmedium calorie Sunday‚Äù. 

I think the all or nothing approach worked better for me. Seeing as how you clearly have some good muscle with a one week fasting routine, maybe I should go back to just pure fasting on Sundays.",0.6799,0.097,0.824,0.079

It clearly shows you‚Äôve taken years to get to the amazingness in which you are now, and with that being said it takes years of consistency and dedication to get to that result. For lack of better words, it‚Äôs a __lifestyle change__ and I think that‚Äôs what some people don‚Äôt get.

* **Context:** Initial 30 days down... going to keep rolling!
* **Length:** OMAD at 2:30PM, strict keto
* **Why:** I was killing myself with booze and food. Gained 50 pounds since retiring from the Army. I finally got sick enough of the bullshit, and a month of quarantine was the perfect vehicle to control what I ate and drank.
* **Notes: FIFTEEN** pounds down! I started at 215 (F, 5'8"", 44) and this morning the scale read 200.2 pounds. That in spite of the fact that I had 5 days completely off the rails. Bought a bottle of vodka and lived off GrubHub every day. I was terrified of getting back on that scale and having my failure stare me in the face. In those days, I went from 201 back up to 207, when I wholly expected to see 220 from all the shit I ate. 

You know what helped me get back up again? I wrote in my journal all of the terrible things   
I've managed to survive in my life. I made a list a page long and suddenly my   
perspective just... shifted. This is NOTHING compared to those things. And now I'm looking   
at 200.2 instead of the 207 I was looking at last Monday. 

The OTHER thing that I can't do without is this community. Even if it's just reading and not

* **Why?**: I was always thin and healthy until two pregnancies, during which I gained way more weight than I should have, and I just never felt motivated to lose it. Two weeks ago my best friend shaved her head because she was losing hair due to a medical condition. She was really upset about it, so I shaved my head with her so she would feel less alone in it. I had a passing thought, imagine if I felt the same kindness for myself that I feel towards my friend. I thought about my children. I feed them a varied, healthy diet. I make activities to help them develop mentally, emotionally, and physically. Imagine if I cared about my health the way I care about my children‚Äôs. So I started studying Latin, journaling, and doing IF. 

* **Notes**: Day 1 (Wed) wasn‚Äôt so bad. Yesterday, day 2, SUCKED. I was tired and grumpy and HUNGRY all day. I wolfed down dinner, and afterwards was so exhausted I fell asleep right away. I woke up this morning feeling like I just had the best night‚Äôs sleep of my entire life. I have spent most of the day outside with my kids. Energy is much better today, physically I am a little weak, but mentally I feel very clear-headed and sharp. I still feel hungry, but it‚Äôs a minor annoyance compared to yesterday when it was basically consuming me. My husband was REALLY concerned yesterday because I was so weak and grumpy, so I told him if I didn‚Äôt feel better in a week I would try something else. I was worried today would be like yesterday, but I feel very encouraged that there‚Äôs such an improvement.",0.9217,0.136,0.774,0.089
"Restarted IF a few days ago, 16:8 but fasting hours usually go beyond that due to my online classes. Diet-wise I follow a loose adaptation of keto, so I still restrict carbs but don't count macros as strictly as keto. I Juul on the regular, and from what I've read, it's okay but wanna hear more perspectives. Doesn't exercise, well, more like I have nowhere to get some exercise due to shelter-in-place.

Last time I went to the GP when I was sick, I was mortified to find out I weighed in at 200lbs which was my highest weight ever. I tried IF back in 2016 for a short period of time and lost some weight so I wanna get back on the wagon and try to lose 60lbs. Sugar cravings were surprisingly the easiest to eradicate, the only thing I'm concerned about is that I'm not eating enough during those 8 hours because of my schedule. Other than that, I try to get as much protein in and drink plenty of water throughout the day. I find that acv with some lemon water really helps keep the hunger pangs from getting too intense.

Hope to see some results soon!",-0.262,0.101,0.793,0.106

Why: Need to lose 15kgs to get to a healthy bmi - aiming for 10kgs atleast. I have been on and off the health wagon for years and years now. I manage to lose 5kgs and then suddenly get tunnel vision for the next few months where I binge and gain it back. Im now trying to start with what seems easiest to change. I am not a night eater and generally have no problems surviving from dinner to a late breakfast so I thought a 16:8 schedule would be a good start. I'm still getting used to the extra few hours of hunger in the morning I need to suffer through. My biggest problem in life is my sweet tooth. Just a schedule change won't make that go away so I'm trying to get out of the sugar cycle long term but it's so hard! :( 

Progress: I'm ten days in.

Length of Fast: 16 hours

Why: my boyfriend really wanted to try it in order to try losing weight, and i wanted to support him. in addition, IF is a great accompaniment to my low carb diet and can help people with pcos lose weight.

Notes: Usually stopping eating after 8pm is easy, but around 9am i start to get hungry since i‚Äôve always been a breakfast eater. i try to drink coffee with just a little bit of creamer and 0 calorie sweetener and exercise right at the end of my fast, but it is still rough at times.",0.4019,0.074,0.867,0.059

Also I'm kind of counting calories just because my house has lots of temptations and fasting doesn't do anything if I'm eating bread and peanut butter and oreo cookies with ice cream...  A ""compromise"" I made with myself is weekends dont have to be strict with the hours, I try to eat better and it makes me feel like it's not the end of the world if I eat something at 7pm lol.


I'm doing this to lose some weight and also I was eating way too much in an unhealthy way. My strategy has been to sleep until 11 or 12 so waiting for lunch gets easier. But I havent seen results since I dont have a scale and I dont expect changes so fast anyway.",0.5346,0.058,0.913,0.029

"Not intermittent but this is how I did it. 

I'm a 35-year-old male currently on day 52 of a 60-day goal. I have lost 10.1kg or 1.59 stone or 22.4 lb or about 9.5% of my original weight.

I know you're going to hate me for this but it really is just a self-discipline thing.

I weighed myself each day which many people said was wrong. The problem with weighing each day is you do get natural variations water retention etc. It is easy to get disheartened but keep going. I have posted a link below to the google sheet I have been using to track it. If you are weighing yourself daily and getting disheartened then have a look at my variations. It's not unusual to be 1kg heavier the next day.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTCQmZ1emZhzr3NW8O4ol\_LgcuueQ-f7WXhmwKmNBvsGvm0g3naFMAJf3l4AHDlAoQw\_2JjMjP1RMCh/pubhtml](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTCQmZ1emZhzr3NW8O4ol_LgcuueQ-f7WXhmwKmNBvsGvm0g3naFMAJf3l4AHDlAoQw_2JjMjP1RMCh/pubhtml)

There are two sheets in the document. The first shows the weight and calories over time. The second is the food and exercise diary. The goal was to aim for around 1,000 calorie intake and a 1-hour walk per day. The result is about 1.3kg loss per week.

I started this exercise not with the intention of losing weight but more to regain some self-discipline. The result has been incredible. I have stopped biting my nails, no longer dependent on alcohol and roughly 30% more productive at work.

My partner who has seen me every day during this process says he hasn't noticed the difference which is again disheartening but when I meet a friend or someone who I have not seen for a few weeks they always comment.

I don't want to fat shame anyone. I get there are so many reasons why we get our selves into these positions but I can not understate how much better I feel physically, mentally, work, just everything. It's been an incredible life-changing experience.

If you are thinking of losing some weight. Start with really small achievable goals. ""I will not drink alcohol this weekend"" or ""I will not eat chips this week"" or ""I will walk 1 hour every day for a week"". Weight loss is like any project. Don't jump straight into the deep end. You will drown. Find a nice small slightly challenging goal. Don't bother weighing yourself during this period as the result will be minor if anything. The goal of this first stage is to build up the self-discipline for a bigger weight loss project.

Once you have achieved a few smaller goals start to increase them. 2 weeks or 4 weeks. etc.",-0.9795,0.077,0.789,0.134

"Might not be the right place but I have been doing the 16/8 fast method for a month or so and seen great weight loss results as well as seeing my abs more. 

Would switching to a fast where I eat 5 days and then 2 days so limited calories(500-600 I read) be more effective? Like will that help me reach my goals faster then a 16/8 fast?",0.9503,0.274,0.648,0.077
"This is a rambling train of thought, it's not really worth sharing but it's on my mind.

I didn't have much weight to lose. Maybe 15, 20 pounds. I'm down 10 pounds with almost zero effort. This is ridiculous. I eat between 11a-7p but I still have a coffee w/ creamer in the morning. Sometimes I eat between 10:30a-7p. Sometimes dinner is late so I just eat less at like 8pm. Sometimes dinner is at 5p and I'm done early. Dunno, not being very strict. Was holding steady at 8 pounds lost. Quarantine meant no more fast food and now I'm dropping slowly again. Two pounds in the last 3 weeks.

I just wanted to say that I love this. I don't feel restricted at all, I didn't even aim for any kind of glucose regulation or anything. It just worked for me like nothing else before. I don't see myself ever gaining weight again. I've always fluctuated up 15 pounds and then get on a strict diet to drop the 15 pounds, rinse and repeat. Not any more! Not to mention, my gut is way more regular and way less troublesome, I stopped getting heartburn near as much, and despite not sticking to a proper strict fasting, my low sugar spikes have only happened *twice* since last year.

And my husband lost some weight too just by doing what I'm doing. He didn't even mean to and he's down like 10 pounds. We're still buying ice cream. We're cooking fried foods in quarantine. But we feel great.",0.1931,0.094,0.797,0.108
"What do you guys do when you plateau on IF? 

I had been on 16:8 for past year, lost about 20-30 pounds of fat, put on about 10-15 pounds of solid muscle, but with quarantine its been tough for gym gains so been doing more bodyweight excercises and HIIT cardio. 

Thinking about tightening up to 20:4. Anyone experience with this before?",0.3313,0.074,0.873,0.053
"CW 147.3, GW: 120. (5'0"")
Day four officially, 16:8 with 1200-1400 kcal depending on if I've worked out. Hungry all the time and I eat okay food but just can't trick myself into enjoying ""clean"" eating (leaves make me sad), plus I frankly need a glass or two of wine to deal with the world. (I've tried giving up both wine and sugar and it's not sustainable, at least not yet.)

It's a struggle but trying to adjust where I can in order to make it work. I'm already doing mild to moderate workouts 3-5 times a week, and I'm trying to move more so I have more calories, but I live in a crowded area. Am currently making myself dizzy by walking in circles around the room as a break from sitting at my desk üòÇ

Previously had good results on low carb diets but since I stocked up for quarantine 80% of my cupboards are rice and pasta. Trying to ration it and eat all my protein and veg first, but I'm not about to pitch it entirely.

But now back at it again and today tried my first 22:2 fast. Didn‚Äôt feel al that different from a 16:8 fast and I‚Äôm thinking about doing that more often.

Still fighting with some bad breath issues but after some digging found out that sugar free gums won‚Äôt have that much of a negative effect. So I‚Äôm sticking with that and drinking lots of water.",-0.8672,0.053,0.823,0.124

My sleep schedule is very sensitive, and one of the ways I've kept it in check has been by always having a big healthy breakfast as soon as I wake up. If you are unaware, breaking your fast also resets your circadian rhythm. I've gone to bed hungry before and that also causes sleeping problems (falling asleep), and I thought that would be worse than skipping breakfast so I opted for a fast from 22-16 (18h fast). But my sleep has already taken a huge hit (no schedule to follow due to the pandemic which also doesn't help).

Need to find some work ethic for home workouts that since it's not very fun for me and I wimp out halfway through. I'm usually a lifter, so I'm doing resistance bands body workouts and some dancing as well. My muscle gain in the past year may be why my appetite seems raised and out of control right now.

I think I might start with 18:6 the first week and then upgrade an hour from there each week until I'm back at 20:4. Then I may add a 36 hour fast once a week (or every other week) until I reach my goal.

"Hello, people of IF! I'm on day 15 of IF and I haven't really lost anything (I've lost a couple of pounds, but it comes right back). I know 15 days isn't long in the grand scheme of things, but I would have expected to lose SOMETHING, especially when I have so much to lose yet. I'm assuming I must not have a strict enough schedule for myself, and I'm trying to build out my schedule. Would love any tips you've got for me, as this whole WFH while doing IF thing is tricky AF lol.

***STATS***  
28F - 5'9"" - 228 - 18:6 - no cal tracking.

***SCHED***

**Mornings -** Black coffee and as much water as I can take. I have a 32oz cup I try to down multiple times before breaking my fast (or a half gallon water bottle, depending on which way I'm feeling like getting my hydration for the day haha). 

**2:00pm -** I try to break my fast right around 2, and have something light with protein and veggies. Ideally that's celery with hummus or a nut butter (could also be an apple with PB or almond butter). Sometimes it's just a protein bar or a smoothie. If I do a smoothie, it's one scoop of protein powder, a massive handful or two of spinach, 1tbsp nut butter, water, a splash of oat milk, flax seeds, and chia seeds. 

**5:00pm / 6:00pm -** Aim to have my main meal around this time. Typically it's a serving of rice with some type of meat (chicken, pork, ground turkey, occasionally-but-rarely beef), a cruciferous green veggie, and a big bowl of greens with a splash of vinaigrette. Although from time to time during quarantine, dinner has been frozen pizza split with my husband haha.

**8:00pm -** I'm usually done eating after dinner, but sometimes if I'm in the mood for dessert, I'll try to have something before 8:00pm. A little bowl of ice cream (trying to cut this out, but it's my weakness), or a few cookies. I try to stick to a serving size when I have dessert. 

I think my big trouble point during quarantine has been beer, tbh. I'm usually done with work around 3:00pm, and then we've been gravitating towards a Happy Hour beer right around then, and having at least one more with dinner. Do you guys think this could be impacting me enough to not be seeing a change in my weight? 

Any other tips would be greatly appreciated! I know having a pre-planned schedule is key, and I'm not planning to give up IF, as it's been the easiest way for me to know I have control over what and how much I eat. It's also the second or third time I've done IF intentionally.

"The more time spent fasting the more effective, as long as you are getting enough nutrients in the feeding windows. 

16:8 is pretty easy to follow while giving a lot of benefits. You don't want to really go above 16:8. One meal a day or 20:4 fasting give more benefits, but it's not as easy to do.

Doing alternate day fasting, where you eat one day and then fast the next, has remarkable effects but it's not easy to follow. Getting in 2 full days of fasting or even just 1 day per week is easier and can be added onto a typical 16:8 routine. 

If you are are wondering what the benefits are, they are numerous. Longer life, type II diabetes prevention/reversal and prevention of certain types of cancer (brain, lung, breast, pancreatic and intestinal if I remember right), protection against certain kinds of dementia and alzheimers, activation of the SIRT/AMPK/MTOR metabolic pathways, lower levels of IGF and better insulin sensitivity, Cardiovascular disease prevention, better weight control. Just make sure you get enough macronutrients while doing IF/fasting during your feeding windows.

Just be careful of doing this too young, it can cause people to not grow to their full potential (reducing Insulin growth factor in the body for example). Being smaller can allow a person to live longer, but there are societal disadvantageous to this.

Most ""effective"" works out to something like 4 or 5 meals a week incorporating 2 back-to-back 72-hour fasts, but that's just not sustainable for the vast majority of people.

For the last hour before I break my fast my brain can be a bit foggy, but I'm wondering if that will adjust in time too.

"About 2 years ago I did OMAD for 30 days and lost 10 pounds. I went off that and gained back 15 since then, which is depressing.

 I'm going to start back with OMAD M-F and then do a 4 hour eating period on Saturdays and Sundays and really enjoy weekend mealtime with my husband and kids. 

I bought a fitbit and hope that it will help me get my steps in, but I want to take it easy for the first month or so. My blood pressure can be low at times, and I do get a bit faint from fasting in the beginnig. I plan on drinking plain water, water with sea salt, coffee, green, black, and rooibos tea during the fasting window.

 During the eating window, my strategy is to fill up on the healthy foods first, focusing on vegetables and protein and then allow for whatever I'm craving during the remainder of the window. 

My concerns are the sustainability of the coming weightloss. This time around, I want to maintain my weightloss which will most likely mean gradually increasing my eating window by one or two hours every month or so. I have been a yo-yo dieter most of my life, and it is very tiring. I'm looking for a life-style change.",0.8482,0.094,0.863,0.043

My goal is really to lose the gut I've developed.  Weight loss will come regardless, because my diet was pretty bad before this, and my alcohol intake was WAY up during quarantine.  SW was 183.5, and I'm already down 4 pounds in 3 days.  I know that will slow.  

Hunger is manageable.  I do black coffee and ice water, alternating between the two to make sure I hit my daily water intake.  1 cup of coffee, don't get another until I finish 32oz of ice water.

"Started IF late December 2019. 

So I intended in early March to take a weeks break from IF to try overcome a mini plateau I was hitting. With the pandemic that week break actually ended up going on for over a month. 

I started getting take outs on a Friday and a Sunday with minimal excerise since the gym was closed.

BUT I made sure I walked during my lunch break Monday to Friday and not eat past 7pm, and when I did have take out it would be the only thing I ate that day.

I hit a plateau around November 2019, stuck at 196lbs. This wasn't quite my goal weight but I felt fine with it because I was doing weight lifting 5x a week and I felt I looked good even without hitting my goal weight. 

The last couple of weeks, however, I find myself gaining weight slowly but steadily and am at 205lbs. I want to lose the extra pounds I put on and, if possible, finally hit that goal weight. 

The strange thing is, I haven't changed anything in my IF (16:8, water/coffee fast, 12 AM to 8 PM) since I started. I'm still sticking to my IF as I always did, but now I'm even gaining some weight.

Notes: I feel slightly discouraged because it seems so easy for my bf, but I'm on day 3 and I've been getting mood swings in the evenings before and after dinner, so much so that I have to avoid him so I don't get irritated or start crying!

I stayed under 1200 calories all week and was the strictest I‚Äôve ever been. I was so ready to give up and eat myself into a hole.

"I was doing IF without calorie restrictions. I started it as a way to get my insulin levels lower, and it did that, and then the weight started coming off. So I'd say it has benefits on it's own.

The only research I‚Äôve seen says IF works through calorie restriction.  There are authorities that say it works because it lowers your insulin and that calories don‚Äôt matter. I haven‚Äôt seen any research to back that claim up. 

That said, for a lot of people (myself included) IF is effective for weight loss without counting calories.",-0.3612,0.09,0.783,0.127
"Very interesting comparison that I've been wondering about as well.
I started 16:8 IF, then moved to 18:6 without counting calories but I was restricting the amount of junk I ate.  I lost about 20 pounds over the last 3 months.  
Now, I want to try to eat some more junk so I moved back to mostly 16:8 or 17:7 with strict calorie counting using my TDEE to cut 1 pound per week.  I'm eating m and m's, ice cream,  etc, just counting it and making sure that I eat 500 calories less per day than my maintenance.
What do you think will happen? Will I continue to lose weight?",-0.7884,0.071,0.814,0.115
"I can only speak about my experience, I've been doing a 16:8 for 1.5 years now and I lost 13kg (28lbs) without restricting calories, while still being quite sedentary. Before IF I would constantly feel bloated after breakfast no matter what I ate (usually bread with jam, but also tried other healthier breakfasts) and that definitely affected the amount of food I ate for lunch (very little). After IF, I started feeling so much better and enjoying my lunch foods way more (pasta, rice, etc. high carb lunch) and still lost weight. Granted I do realize I've naturally cut back on bread in general, so that might also be it, but I still eat my sweets every day. So yea, a light form of IF has been the only thing that worked for me to shed those few pounds and maintain my weight without even trying.",0.9378,0.151,0.785,0.065
"> does intermittent fasting work only because it's a form of calorie restriction?

For weight loss?  Yes.

Fasting makes it *easier* to restrict calories, reducing hunger, but make no mistake that weight loss is primarily driven by calorie restriction.  You cannot eat more in a smaller timeframe, and expect to lose weight.",-0.9521,0.029,0.621,0.349
"It works because there‚Äôs a chemical change in your body that occurs at 16~ hours of not eating. That change has awesome benefits including fat loss.

"I'm good example of that- did not change what I eat, only when. Big disclaimer-my IF wasn't for weight loss purposes and my diet was already very healthy. Weight loss was side effect to my initial reason(to get off heart medication) to start IF nearly 7 years ago. I'm still fasting daily, haven't seen cardiologist or taken heart meds for about 6 years(with his blessing), still eating same amounts of food and my weight hasn't really changed since it dropped steady in first 6 months of fasting(maybe additional 500g of  winter padding every year that promptly disappears when sunshine returns).",0.863,0.123,0.854,0.023

I know that's not much, but I feel like my weight loss journey is starting to gain some momentum. Not sure why, but I think it takes a couple weeks or so for the weight loss to start kicking in. Don't get too discouraged! (Also I started taking walks everyday for like 45 min to an hour before my feeding window starts and that also helped!)",0.5615,0.13,0.755,0.115
"I have a similar problem when I start but I also count calories and do low carb keto.  It takes me about 4 weeks to be keto adapted and stop being hungry.  I don‚Äôt know why it takes my body so long but I‚Äôm Lucky like that.  

Are you counting calories?  The IF only works if you are also restricting.  I‚Äôm at 2 weeks now and just starting to lose my sugar cravings.  I workout 3 times a week.  I‚Äôve also not lost a single ounce.  

From previous experience, around week 4 I stop being hungry and my body adapts to 1-2 small meals per day around 700 calories.  I can then easily fast for prolonged periods of time too.  Then weight loss happens.",-0.7584,0.095,0.753,0.152

"Hi. I started out on Jan. 2nd a little above your start weight (mine was 188lbs) and have been sticking to 16:8 at first, then went down to 18:6 for about 2 weeks now and my last weight was 179.5lbs, but I don't seem to be losing any more weight and I don't know why. The entire month of January I ate nothing but a Whole30 way of eating (no grains, no dairy, no alcohol, no sugar) I've even just started doing 15 minute HIIT exercises 3x a week coming from absolutely ZERO exercise for like, my whole life practically-I've never been a gym goer or runner or anything like that.  (I just turned 51). I'm wondering if I'm just doomed because as a peri-menopausal woman, I can't seem to get rid of this belly weight. :( Maybe I'm expecting too much too soon.

She told me that it really comes down to commitment and discipline (like any diet) and that she has seen good results for men and women of all ages. Her information/suggestion to me was to give it a try because it doesn‚Äôt work for everyone‚Äôs lifestyle. Some are really successful with fasting and others struggle more.

"I would recommend starting with the basics and doing 16:8, because that generally just means skipping breakfast. Your 8 hours can be any time, though, if you find you want to eat when you wake up, you just close your window earlier. For example, I eat from 12p-8pm so the majority of my fast is while I‚Äôm asleep and I have black coffee in the mornings and I‚Äôm not very hungry until 11 or so, so I only have about an hour where I am ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù on food and trying to distract myself. 

After I got the hang of that, I shortened my window and have started doing 18:6 so I am eating between 1pm and 7pm. I have intermingled some longer fasts in there but having a routine really helps me and doing the 16:8 helped me get used to the feeling of hunger that helped me get through a 24h fast. 

Next step (IMO) would be to do something like ADF or 5:2 but I‚Äôm still getting my 18:6 routine going.",0.7677,0.069,0.907,0.024

"Today is day 12 of IF with water, herbal tea and black coffee sweetened with a dash of powdered stevia.

Originally, I was doing 16:8, but two days ago I was able to do 17.5:6.5, and then yesterday I accomplished 18:6. I'm calculating calories (1400) using MyFitnessPal. So far I've lost 4 lbs. I wish it were more, but I'm reminding myself not to be impatient!

One thing I've learned so far is that it is possible for me to drink black coffee if I sweeten it with stevia. I've never been able to tolerate coffee without cream before. During my eating window, I have coffee with almond milk creamer, which I greatly enjoy. The black coffee I just tolerate so far, but it serves my purposes. I don't have to *like* it.

"I have been doing 16:8 (though closer to 18:6) for about a week. The only complaint I have is having to drink plain water during the fasting periods. I'm not hungry, but terribly thirsty. I get chapped lips and dry mouth when it's just plain water, which is super annoying. I have had this problem forever, which is why I started drinking sparkling water.

It does help a ton, but the sparkling water I drink is sweetened with aspartame or sucralose (depending which one I get). So, I think that breaks a fast or is at least not recommended. I hate the ones that aren't sweetened, so I won't even bother with those.

Anything else that would help? Could I just need electrolyte drinks or something? I have tried using those Ultima packets, but haven't noticed much difference.

I don't drink the sparkling water straight - I use 1 bottle a day. It's 32 ounces and I basically have like 1/4 of it in every 20 ounce of water I drink, then I have plain water during my workout, so still about 80-90 ounces of plain water mixed with the 32 ounces of sparkling water.

"I'm new to this and having second thoughts, just 3 days in.

I started consuming an average of 1200 calories a day about 2 months ago, and also exercising several times a week whether that be running, cycling, or weight lifting. I'm so short I really don't lose weight if I eat more than 1200 calories or don't exercise. I didn't keep track the first month, but I lost 7 lbs in the second month (138 to 131 lb). Goal weight is 120 lb. Basically I was eating \~200 calories for breakfast at 9 am, \~400 calories for lunch at 1 pm, and \~600 calories for dinner at 6 pm, no real snacking. I already naturally don't eat much sugar, bread, soda, animal fats, etc. but I'm a little thick because I eat a lot of things like nuts, avocado, hummus, and other high calorie plants and am short.

Now I'm doing IF (12 pm to 8 pm eating window, but actually in practice it's more like 12 pm to 6 pm eating window since I don't feel like snacking after dinner). \~1200 calories within that window. I find it really easy to go from 6 pm to 12 pm or later the next day without eating. Like, I fall asleep hungry but once I wake up the hunger pangs are gone. However, once I eat lunch (\~500 calories and have achieved feeling full), after an hour passes past lunch it's really hard to hold myself over until dinner. I can't concentrate after I've eaten lunch. I was so productive these past couple months but now I feel like I've just wasted noon until dinner time these last few days just trying to focus and being unable. I gave in and had a post-lunch yogurt today (lunch was roasted potatoes, a vegan ""turkey"" burger, and a fried egg on top) and I feel like it just made the hunger worse. I also just feel more anxiety and have a feeling my heart beat is faster although I haven't checked. Will this get better? It's only been a couple days. I'm thinking about going back to what I was doing, since it was working anyway and felt super comfortable. I almost feel like OMAD would be easier than having a window for 2 meals because then I can just rely on the same fasting momentum that got me through the morning. 

My main reasons for wanting to try IF is because I'm someone who gets crabby leading up to meals or gets dizzy randomly and I don't want to have to rely on the glucose spiking. I also read that IF is better for keeping muscle gains and losing belly fat.",0.9635,0.115,0.807,0.078

And with regards to actual fasting I have seen research that talks about 3 day fasts lowering white blood cell count(research was about fasting and  chemotherapy tolerance).

"Is the WBC count lower for YOU or lower than the reference range? What is your ANC and ALC? (Neut and lymph absolutes) Did you get your blood drawn while fasting as well?

Although doctors don't always believe or know this, I did a few CEUs recently (I work in healthcare) about fasting CBC values and they DO change when fasted compared to nonfasted. Also WBC and absolute counts are highly variable and need to be taken into context of the individual, not necessarily the reference range. 

So for fasting, if you were fasting when you had your blood drawn, WBC counts are typically lower. After eating, an immune response is triggered (fat is processed via the lymphatic system which is a primary site for immune cells thus fatty meals can really trigger the immune system) thus increasing your count temporarily. When people eat 16+ hrs of the day their counts are always elevated slightly thus increasing the reference range values and making you look like an outlier. 

If you have no history of a low count then this could be a problem, but if you have history of being historically on the lower side then your doctor needs to take your results in context. Your doctor can order a peripheral smear for leukopenia or do a smear review themselves if they feel comfortable or order a heme/onc consult but honestly unless it is less than 1.0 and without any other symptoms, you are probably totally normal.",0.3999,0.08,0.847,0.073
"Hello I'm a female 24 and I went from 8 weeks of 16:8 started on February 17 to OMAD last Sunday the 19th of April. My goal weight is 120 and I started fasting due to lowering my cholesterol and obtaining self discipline. I am fasting from sugar and carbs mainly. My current hours are 21:3 and surprisingly it's not as hard because I started doing the 16:8. 

I also got into fasting because when I was in college I gained like 50 pounds and I'm only 5 feet so it made me obese for my height. I struggled with depression and anxiety and I feel like with my new eating habits i am doing better with my mental health issues. 

I used to be very slow and sluggish and sleep all day but ever since I began fasting and eating healthy portioned meals I have energy, I'm happier and I am not lazy anymore. My self confidence has improved. I feel closer to God (I also fast due to my faith).  I guess in total I have been fasting for about 10/11 weeks. 

I would love to get down to 120 and then fast to maintain my weight. Fasting has also helped me with my Binge Eating Disorder and emotional eating. I am more mindful of what I put into my body. I am very happy about where I am spiritually mentally and physically.

I try to eat at least 1000-1200 calories a day. My concern is that sometimes it doesn't seem to be very filling but I know you are supposed to feel a little hunger to lose weight so Idk...

"Hello everyone :)
I have been doing intermittent fasting for about a three weeks now. I started with 16:8, then quickly moved onto 18:6, and I have been doing OMAD for the last five or six days because I just don't feel that hungry anymore.
I wanted to get a bit leaner and lose some body fat. I have accomplished so, I have started to see more definition in my body, my abs are showing much more. 
My main concern is that I might not be eating enough calories, even though I feel fine most of the time. I felt a bit dizzy and tired for the first days, but not so much anymore. I have been eating paleo this whole time, and I didn't eat much sugar or carbs before, other than a lot of bread, which has been the most difficult thing I've stopped eating, and rice, which I have just swapped with veggies. 
Also, has anyone got any experience with trying to put muscle on whilst on IF?

SW ON 04/14 : 210lb
GW : 140lb

My IF is the 3 days and I accompany it with daily sport and fitness :)

I'm motivated and I wish you all the best!",0.9499,0.271,0.696,0.033
"I've been involuntarily fasting for about a month because of a wisdom tooth that needed to come out. Chewing was difficult. I've lost about five pounds. 

I've been eating anything liquid or very soft that I can get down, which isn't much. organic vegetable juice, banana, soft soup, yogurt. 

5'4.5""

I was 129 pounds. Now 124 pounds and bmi about 21. 

That is still normal bmi so why do I feel so hungry? I'm not even close to underweight. But really, all I want to do is eat cookies, donuts, and some real food. 

What do I do once I can chew again? Should I try to stay at this weight? Do I gain back and go to my usual weight? 

If I am  going to make a permanent change to my diet, I suppose now would be the time. So any ideas about what I should be eating regularly once I can eat what I choose?

I'm hoping I can reset  my brain somewhat with good health techniques. I'm about 7.5 months sober. Trying to get rid of some reduced emotions / feeling, and some brainfog. 

About 4 hours out of my fast. I definitely notice immediate results, but only time will allow me to see how it worked out for me. I feel good though! Less foggy for sure.

Roughly half way there in terms of weight! 


Type: water/coffee (mostly)
Context: today marks one month since I started
Length: 16:8 minimum, mostly 18:6
Why?: lose weight for health and vanity reasons.


After one month of IF I am... Well I'm amazed with the results. Never been a small/average sized, but when I was playing rugby in college I lost a fair bit of weight and put on muscle. Fast forward to injury, uni, losing interest and so on and it wasn't pretty.

So I decided to use this lockdown as an opportunity to take up IF and get to a healthy a weight as possible. I use Zero to track fasts, MFP to count calories (mostly 1200-1300, though it tells me to aim for 1500),and a Fitbit for steps (try to do 15k a day, but most of these are just walking in the spot). I can still fit in the odd beer or chocolate (okay, chocolate is daily most of the time) and meet my nutrient goals including plenty of protein. 

I don't really get hungry anymore and don't miss breakfast - though once I have to stay traveling to and from work again I can see this changing (hopefully by then I'll be in maintenance and a bit of breakfast won't hurt).

I know that 6.7kg in one month is more than what is advisable for some people, but I don't seem to be suffering any negative impacts and i make sure I hit my nutrient goals on MFP (though  carbs are now entirely from fruit and veg, have bread and rice a couple of times a week only, instead of every day). I feel much healthier and have started to notice some visible changes, too.

So yeah, this is kinda a testament to the methodology (I don't snack outside my period, generally eating less even during my eating period), a record of change in case I ever have doubts, and encouragement for people I n my position. Once I reach goal weight (and learn to maintain it - certainly not exceed it), I intend to keep up with IF. Currently my morning coffees have milk and sugar, so I know that the fast has technically ended when I drink them, but once goal weight is reached I plan to change/stop this entirely in line with IF guidelines and take advantage if other benefits. Hopefully I can make this a permanent and fundamental lifestyle change.

I've dropped 10 pounds since I started IF not quite a month ago. I've noticed that once I get back to this weight (180ish) I often stop IF because I'm no longer totally repulsed by my weight. I found myself binging last night and ate 1000 calorie pint of ice cream and have been tempted all day to snack. But I'm not going to do it! I'm going to stick to OMAD get back on track and keep losing so I reach my college weight of 165.,-0.7508,0.02,0.875,0.105

* **Type** of fast Only water
* **Context** of fast 10pm-2pm
* **Length** of fast 16:8
* **Why?** Gains while maintaining low BF%
* **Notes:**

In the midst of the covid plague, I obviously haven't been lifting heavy much (no access to a barbell, etc. A fault I plan to rectify with a home gym in the future). That said I have been doing a lot of cardio and body weight resistance training at home. I also read about the benefits of intermittent fasting (where I fast for 16 hours and then eat as well as possible for 8). So far the body fat has just flown off me, and I feel fantastic. For the first time ever I can see definition in my torso that I haven't ever before.

My question is, when I return to lifting and want to focus on strength and size, should I stop fasting and switch back to my normal diet? Or maybe scale back a bit to a 12:12 pattern? The objective is to still make gains while not taking on too much body fat, and at the same time reap the purported hormonal benefits of fasting. My gut says that as long as I eat at a caloric surplus during my 8 hour window (which is tough not gonna lie), get enough macro/micronutrients (especially that 2 g protein/kg lean weight/day), and plenty of sleep, I should be okay?",0.9606,0.119,0.831,0.049

"You can tell her 2 things. 

1) it actually slows down aging and promotes longer years of good health. Some science regarding aging is discussed in here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DtWqzalEnc . You activate sirt, ampk, and mtor pathways that gets the cells to focus on repair and efficiency, rather than growth and reproduction, when you intermittent fast or even do alternate day fasting. During a period of fasting NAD+ levels will rise in relation to NADH, which is what triggers a lot of these mechanisms (exercise has similar effects, as well as potentially NAD supplementation NR/NMN).

2) Insulin levels are kept lower during a fast, which allows the body to more easily access stored fat and consequently increases your metabolism. It also seems that intermittent fasting reduces hunger while losing weight in comparison to eating 3-5 meals a day while losing weight. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIuj-oMN-Fk goes into the metabolic differences between the weight loss approaches as well as why insulin does what it does. How insulin acts as a signal for the body to store energy and also as an inhibitor of fat burning (with higher insulin levels the body will first lower metabolism/body heat, then after a certain point burn fat. with low insulin levels like during a fast it will simply burn the fat unimpeded). 

So in pretty much all cases intermittent fasting is simply the healthiest way to eat, whether you are losing weight or not due to improved longevity and health. But there are added benefits when it's used to lose weight, less hunger, better metabolism/body heat, improved muscle composition while losing weight.


If you were 18 or younger it would be better to eat 3-5 times a day, due to higher levels of insulin increasing Insulin Growth Factor. However after you turn 19 you really don't need to keep growing, and igf starts becoming linked to certain types of cancers. What you want is to maintain your longevity/health and improve your bodies efficiency, which is what IF will do by lowering your insulin and activating your bodies internal repair pathways (sirt, ampk, mtor).",0.9232,0.122,0.795,0.084

* **Type** of fast: OMAD 23:1 intermittent fasting
* **Context** of fast: Day 1 because ever since I have been working from home, my desire to eat crappy food has grown. So I've put on weight (CW 190, used to be 180-185) that I want to get rid of. Long term I want to reach 115 lbs (my old weight) but 23:1 is not very sustainable for me so I will transition back to 19:5 later
* **Length** of fast: 23 hours
* **Why?** Intermittent fasting always gives me a feeling of clean-ness (lol sorry not sure what is the best word) so I'm hoping to gain that from doing a 23:1 today
* **Notes:** It would be amazing if I was able to achieve the full 23 hours because I usually give up too easily. Before I started on this 23:1 I did have some unhealthyish food (sausage and rice) but I think if I finish this 23 hours I would have consumed less calories from that meal compared to how I usually snack/stress eat in a day.",0.9738,0.164,0.802,0.034
"**Type:** Water/coffee/electrolyte fast

**Context:** Starting Monday night at 11pm, going until 11am/noon on Thursday

**Length:** 60 hours

**Why:** Further weight loss reasons, wish to seek the enlightenment fasting brings. Further proofing out the 2-day fast. I'm currently learning the art of the 48 hr fast to be able to scale into longer, extended fasts. 

**Notes:** Going well so far, learned a couple of things yesterday. 

I may have to rethink water consumption. I drink water for two reasons, namely for satiety purposes and for energy purposes. I've classically thought that water was great for filling the stomach and making you feel less hungry. What I've also learned with water is that drinking it after my morning coffee gives me enough sustainable energy to make it through the whole day as I noticed previously being chronically dehydrated made me more tired. I would naturally drink an energy drink, which makes me more dehydrated, which makes me more tired, which makes me grab another energy drink, repeat ad nauseum. So overall, that is why I've been drinking a lot of water; both for satiety and energy. 

What occurred to me yesterday was that I'm not generally thirsty enough to justify the amount of water I'm drinking daily. After my morning coffee, I didn't drink any water. What happened was that I felt really tired after about an hour and I even slept through to about 3pm, which confirms the hypothesis that drinking coffee and not hydrating makes me tired. What surprised me is that I drank far less water towards the end of the day and I magically didn't feel as hungry. I had one hunger pang and I simply drank about one gulp of water and it went away. Before I slept at 11pm, I drank a liter of an electrolyte-laden water (1 liter of water, 1 tsp of nu salt, 0.5 tsp of salt) in addition to my multivitamin and magnesium (citrate). I noticed this gave me hunger pangs after drinking and made me feel bad in the stomach region, though I couldn't entirely describe why. Perhaps it was because I chugged a liter of the stuff right before bed. 

What I'm doing today is drinking electrolyte mix after my morning coffee and then holding off drinking unless I'm legitimately hungry at which point I'll take modest sips. 

Upon my second day, I feel calmer this morning than I did yesterday which is a trend I observed during my first 48 hr fast. I could get addicted to this feeling and feeling this makes me more curious what could happen with longer fasts.",0.4715,0.068,0.881,0.052

Living with my parents during this pandemic so changing eating habits is difficult, but decided to try IF this week because I am working afternoons and can stop eating after lunch. I feel weird keeping secrets but my parents aren't open to the idea of skipping meals and it's easier for me to fib and say I packed a dinner or picked something up on my way home than to try to explain IF or justify my eating habits. My mom has a really critical view of food due to her weight struggles and my sister's which isn't helpful.
It isn't good for enabling ketosis, but I permit myself coffee with milk or cream to fend off the food cravings. I am doing IF for caloric restriction and this makes me feel less like I am depriving myself.",-0.9568,0.04,0.794,0.166
