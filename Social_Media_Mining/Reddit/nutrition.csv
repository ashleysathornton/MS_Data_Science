"Don’t have a nutrition degree but I’ve been intermittent fasting for awhile and have lost a good amount of weight. You are absolutely right about calories, but your friend is also right about IF. It’s easier to maintain a caloric deficit when you fast for 16-18 hours a day and focus on your calories and macronutrients in the 6-8 hour eating window",0.7469,0.166,0.743,0.091

It’s a complex interplay of environment, genetics, psychology, hormones and other stuff. If you’re serious about this, head on over to coursera and take the short course Weight management: Beyond the calories

Aside from IF being a strategy to reduce the amount calories you are able to take in, it has other health benefits as well as beautifully explained here [NEJM article ](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1905136). When I prescribe this to my patients (and when I started IF as well), it’s important to do it in increments (as described in the last part of the article) so you won’t develop hunger pangs and migraine headaches. 

A common misconception is you can take in as many calories as you want during your eating period. You still have to adhere to the  recommended quantity and QUALITY of calories that you consume within the eating time to make the whole strategy effective.",0.9042,0.11,0.856,0.034

In terms of other physiological effects of intermittent fasting? That may be up for debate:

""The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which IF improves health and counteracts disease processes involve activation of adaptive cellular stress response signaling pathways that enhance mitochondrial health, DNA repair and autophagy. PF also promotes stem cell-based regeneration as well as long-lasting metabolic effects. Randomized controlled clinical trials of IF versus PF and isoenergetic continuous energy restriction in human subjects will be required to establish the efficacy of IF in improving general health, and preventing and managing major diseases of aging.""

"I’m not sure about the Autophagy and all the other benefits that are claimed by IF but I can tell you my personal experience and it has been great! I don’t think fasting itself makes you burn or lose more fat. I do low carb and IF together and I think this is why it works for me. Calories are reduced because I have 2 small or 1 big meal within a 4 hour eating window. (Only carbs I eat are veggies, rarely do I indulge in sugar and refined carbs) This makes having a calorie deficit so much easier, which is the only way to lose weight. Because I only eat once a day I go all out on my meals and make them whole foods that are nutritional and supplement anything I may be missing. My blood sugar levels have stabilized and I assume this because I do not crave sugar or carbs and am not hungry during my fasting period, however, I do not have medical proof of this. I am hydrated better because through-out the fasting period lemon water gets me by. And I do workout fasted which there has been a lot of debate about but for me it’s great I can progressively overload my lifting and get a good cardio session in too. But you can always set up your eating window to best suit your needs. I have noticed a lot of muscle mass and fat loss over the past 5 months and my smart scale reflects that. 
Although this has been great for me and I’ve seen results I don’t think IF is the only way. You can find success if you find a regime you love and works for your own life. It’s hard to verify all the cellular stuff they say happens in your body. I do have a urine ketone detector and I have checked to see ketones right before my eating window and it just barley changes colour. So that would indicate I have burning some fat instead of glycogen. But I also hear those are not always accurate.

"I’m studying for a degree in nutrition and tbh I’m still torn about whether its plain and simple ‘calories in vs calories out’ - this is a question of physics, energy in must equal energy used, rather than physiology. However would someone with a TDEE of 2000 gain weight if they ate 2,300 calories worth of Broccoli? I doubt it. Your body metabolises different nutrients in different ways, for example carbohydrate sugars are preferentially stored as fat over protein. Moreover different carbs are metabolised differently. 

I suggest it’s likely that intermittent fasting could aid in a healthy lifestyle or weight loss, given that the person is maintaining a healthy diet. IF but still watching chocolate and pizza is unlikely to help. The idea behind IF is that it allows your digestive system to rest and avoid constant inflammation, although I’m unsure if this impacts weight. 

However, I suspect that the main benefit to weight loss is the altered mindset of people who IF. I feel passionately that weight gain/loss is largely determined by people’s relationship with food; so many people gain back the weight they lost because they can’t maintain the false relationship with food they had when temporarily dieting. IF likely allows people to reconsider how they see food - as nutrients and a necessity, rather than a pass-time - it’s gives them a break from constantly thinking about food, although this may be difficult for yo-yo dieters.

"(This is off the top of my head, so forgive me and feel free to correct me if I get some of the details mixed up)

I think intermittent fasting is legit. Here are some specific reasons why:

1. Your body has a pecking order when it comes to its preferred fuel source. In general, it will use up the glucose from your most recent meal first. Once that’s gone, it’ll turn to its glycogen stores which last something like 8-12 hours. After that, your body will start to use its fat reserves as the primary fuel source. So if you’re overweight and looking to specifically burn some body fat (as opposed to build muscle, which this will not help with) it seems like waking up in the morning (when glycogen is just about depleted) eating nothing, and doing some moderate intensity aerobics is a smart way to go about it to me. 

2. Caloric restriction is strongly correlated with overall longevity. There’s a lot of literature on this topic, but the way I think about this is to recognize that the human organism did not evolve to exist in a state of perpetual abundance. Prolonged periods without food have always been the norm, and these periods induce what’s called a “starvation response.” The shifts in our preferred fuel source are just one facet of that response. Speaking very broadly, it seems like at least some elements of the starvation response (when not taken to the extreme) have very positive effects on overall health. Like avoiding the development of diabetes, for example. My sense is that a big part of the reason type II DM develops is because some people don’t ever allow their bodies to move between “fed” and “fasting.” They are perpetually in “fed” mode, which means they’re perpetually producing insulin, and eventually it’s like a boy-who-cried-wolf situation. Your body seems to stop responding to the insulin signals, and voila! You’ve got diabeetus. 

So yeah, my general opinion is that some amount of fasting is absolutely healthy.",0.9773,0.105,0.864,0.031
"There are actually quite a few things that are beneficial (other than caloric deficit). I think the main thing for me is: autophagy. Which is: the body's way of cleaning out dead / damaged cells. Autophagy is much, much more effective when fasting. It gives your body time to not be metabolizing calories, which can be extremely beneficial (not just for losing weight).",-0.1548,0.126,0.74,0.134
"Calories in vs. Calories out is correct, but the thing is that calories out changes a bunch depending on what you do.  The basic premise of IF is that your body wants to be at a certain weight (much like you want your house to be at a certain temperature).  When you eat more calories in, then your body tries to burn more calories to keep your body at its target weight.  Conversely when you eat less calories, your body starts to try and conserve energy and lowers calories out (By slowing down your metabolism.)  So the big argument of IF is that calories out is extremely dependent on calories in, and in the long run your body will always be attempting to return to its target weight.  

IF claims that the way to reduce your body weight target (Or turn down the temperature in your house) is by fasting.  They claim that your metabolism slows down if you consistently eat less than needed, whereas if you don't eat at all for prolonged periods, your metabolism doesn't slow down.  The reason for this they claim, is because evolutionary speaking, when your body isn't getting any food, you need to be at peak performance to be able to obtain food.  They also claim that weight loss is all about insulin management rather than restricting calories.  I am not great at explaining the arguments, but I will leave a link below to a credible website that is great at making the case for intermittent fasting

I'm sure the actual truth is somewhere in the middle, but I think there is some truth to every diet and something you can learn from.  A lot of people claim that IF is only successful because less calories in, but that is not what the science is based on, the science is based on more calories out.  But go to their subreddit and you can clearly see it is a successful weight loss strategy, and I think it has a bunch of health benefits outside of weight loss.

"It’s a great tool for wight maintenance and also overall health. But most people have a hard time doing it because their body is not used to running on ketones, so once they run out of readily available glucose, they feel irritable, dizzy and hangry. So ‘getting fat adapted’ first will be greatly beneficial to someone wanting to fast. Which means spending prolonged periods in ketosis, like a few days here and there. If you think about humans before we mastered agriculture, we often had circumstances where there was no food available, and our bodies are very good at dealing with that. But in the modern world it’s rare for us to have to switch to fat burning, so it feels weird or bad.

&#x200B;

I tried IF because I don't get hungry early in the morning anyway. Doctor recommended, with an ""easy to follow"" diet that only meant no added sugar and mode vegetables. Did it gradually, one week for one hour. Reached 16:8 and I was SO cranky all the time. Lasted two months total, didn't lose any significant amount of weight (it was less than 2 kilos, total). And I freaking hated every minute of it. I'm pretty sure I have an unhealthy relationship with food, or maybe with being told when I can eat.

Reluctantly doing IF now because my workplace reduced hours and took away lunch time, so either I try to break fast at 7 am (which would mean sleeping less) or wait till noon. I'm waiting. It's been 39 days... No weight lose at all. I still hate every freaking minute of it. It's not even that I'm hungry, I'm not.

IF is a means to an end - it least you control the amount of calories takes as there's a smaller window of time during the day when you eat so it's almost impossible to eat too much for the whole day during that time without it being blatantly obvious.

I'm personally not a fan - for a more active person it would mean you'd need to cram a lot more calories upfront which promotes storing fat by the body.

I think low GI food and a slight caloric deficit is the way to go if you need to lose weight.

You can get the deficit by eating less or being active more (or both)",-0.4168,0.069,0.831,0.1

"If it were only that simple haha

There are a lot of things that impact how many calories the body burns and what type of calories are being consumed (yes, not all calories are the same). 

Using intermittent fasting as opposed to a standard diet increases your overall metabolism, because your body is sending itself into a state of stress to try and find more food (not bad stress, we’re actually evolved to have this kind of stress on a regular basis). So you’ll end up burning more calories even if you’re doing nothing. 

Also, studies have shown that when stressing your body with intermittent fasting or cold exposure (check out Wim Hof Method, changed my life), you burn significantly more fat during exercise. This is in contrast to our normal eating rhythm, which triggers our body to burn mostly carbs.

"Intermittent-fasting is a type of diet that can be divided into 3 subclasses: (a) alternate-day fasting (ADF), (b) whole-day fasting (WDF) & (c) time-restricted feeding (TRF). Nowadays, I mostly hear about the time-restricted feeding subclass with an eating window of 4-8 hours and then fasting the rest time of the day (16-20 hours). When an individual is trying to lose weight and fat through diet, definetely there has to be a caloric deficit (that means that the calories you take must be less than the calories you burn). When exercising the calories you burn are more & modifications on the caloric content should be made in order to better cover the energy needs. Although, many people have seen results with intermittent fasting, recent researchs' results suggest that when comparing IF with continuous energy restriction, the effects on body weight & body composition are equivalent. However, there is mentioned that IF may be superior at suppressing hunger. It is worth noting, that many people who do IF usually don't consume food ad libitum during the eating window; they take care of what & how much of it they are going to cosnume.

Generally, I think people choose which type or pattern of diet they are going to follow according to what they feel is going to work for each one them. As long as they follow a healthy & balanced diet that covers their needs in all the important nutrients, they can lead in losing weight and keeping healthy.",0.8689,0.089,0.864,0.047

"I lost 100 lbs/45 kg with IF.

Just to clear something up real quick, IF isn't a diet, its just timing meals.  It does work excellent with Keto diet, that's what I did, because it maximizes your time in ketosis with long periods of not raising insulin levels.

Metabolism is the combination of all your cells utilizing energy.  Your body has two sources of this energy: Glucose and Ketones.  The problem with glucose as a fuel source is you need insulin to ""unlock"" the cells so they can accept it as energy, this part is good.  The bad part is insulin is an anabolic hormone that promotes fat storage (lipogenesis) and inhibits fat burning (lipolysis).  This is the opposite of a weight loss goal.

What can happen with the Standard American Diet (not sure where you are from) is the common foods are packed full of simple sugars and highly processed carbs.  This spikes insulin levels very high, which inhibits fat burning, body fat is like a battery of potential energy but you don't have access to it with high insulin.  

So lets say you eat sugar/processed carbs but you are not getting enough energy to feed your cells.  They can't tap into your battery so they are forced to lower their energy use.  This is the drop in metabolism.

Ketones, the other fuel source, is created when you burn fat.  If your body is depleted of glucose and glycogen stores (carbs stored in your body) it will be forced to burn fat.  With no glucose around insulin levels are low and you are then utilizing your bodies batteries (the fat).  You are getting then getting the energy you need, its just food you ate years ago.  

You are already almost eating Keto right now, all you have to do its ditch the carrots and replace with broccoli or asparagus or a salad would work (watch out for the dressings).  You can have your burger just without the bun, but some sharp cheddar on it, it would be in your food plan.  That's not a cheat day, that's just food on keto.

1.  Prioritize protein, you need to make sure you are getting enough protein first of all.

2.  Limit carbs, under 20 grams if you want ketosis 24/7 but with 16/8 IF you can go above it and still go into ketosis before your next meal.

3.  Fill rest of calories with healthy fat...which I mean nothing ""trans fat"" or anything that says ""partially hydrogenated"" in the ingredients list.  

Fat from food does NOT equal fat on your body.  In fact an essential nutrient is something needed to sustain life that your body cannot produce itself.  You NEED fats and proteins, there is no essential carbs.

I strongly suggestion ""clear Keto"" vs. ""dirty Keto"" with your food choices but from what you are eating now you are pretty clean.

I know they are also working on an updated guide on intermittent fasting.

"Although every diet should be specific and individual for each circumstance, they all operate on the basic principle of a caloric deficit. A caloric deficit will dictate if you either gain or lose weight, and that is known by the majority of people that have a little knowledge about basic nutrition. Intermittent fasting is a tool for the many to ""control"" the number of calories you intake per day, based on the fact that you have less time to eat and therefore, fewer meals. But fasting or not, as long as you follow a healthy balanced diet, skip high calorie-dense foods and keep your body active, you can lose weight either way. Keep it simple.

If you don't control how much of a deficit you stress your metabolism into, the chances are that you will do more harm than good. Sometimes, more is absolutely less when it comes to the correlation between how hard you hit your deficit and your long term weight loss.

The bottom line is that it doesn't matter if you are following any intermittent fasting protocols if your intake is higher than your output of energy. Keep a well established and healthy deficit and you will see fat loss with any diet.",-0.8886,0.107,0.738,0.155

"> To elaborate a bit further, which method between OMAD (One meal a day) vs Intermittent fasting will provide the most overall biological benefits?

To the best of my knowledge there really isn't any compelling evidence base at this point that any form of IF/TRF (time-restricted feeding) in humans actually beats continuous energy restriction for most stuff we'd care about (fat loss, metabolic health improvement, etc.).

There's some stuff on paper about why it might and some promising animal research, but I think it's premature to draw those sorts of conclusions in people until more research is available.  And the bigger issue in my mind is compliance - the more barriers you add to compliance, the less reasonable it becomes to recommend these sorts of interventions to large groups of people, in my opinion.  Because most dietary approaches fail not because the particulars don't work on paper, but because people stop doing them at some point.

> What are the pros and cons of both? Are the differences very negligible?

So let's take OMAD.  To me the upside here is very little, given the evidence we have - we absolutely can't prove it's better than other forms of IF, much less more continuous styles of energy restriction.  And while you'll have a lot of people swear it's easy for them to do, the idea of large segments of the population mentally and otherwise being okay with eating one meal a day, and then counting on them to have balanced micronutrient intake etc. in that context, makes this wildly impractical to recommend for most people imo.

I mean sure, it's an interesting approach, and I hope more research is done, but even if you want to go the IF route, I can't fathom why you'd pick OMAD.

16/8 type IF approaches work in part, in my opinion, because they actually do start becoming somewhat practical, and if somebody hasn't tried any form of IF/TRF before, this is where I'd start.  Because if we can't actually establish any of these are superior to normal dieting, you might as well do the one that's easiest to maintain compliance-wise, which would clearly be comparatively longer periods eating, effectively just skipping breakfast.",0.9896,0.144,0.807,0.049

I won’t restrict myself. I tell myself “I know I can eat whatever I want, but just not now. A few more hours and I can eat.” But by the time I’m in my feeding window I forget about the whole snack craving thing and end up eating the meal I make.

"I've been intermittent fasting for the last 4 years. I was a gym rat and a distance runner, ended up with a stress fracture in my foot during a marathon which coupled with a bone spur in my shoulder just as my stress fracture was healing up. The stress fracture and the surgery on my shoulder left me unable to workout as I had been for a year and a half all told.

I needed something that would keep me from overeating since I love to eat and I eat a lot when I do. IF was the answer for me, still ate a very big dinner, but that was the only time I ate.

Side affects? I've felt light headed before, and also felt tiredness that I think wouldn't have been there had I eaten. But that's not often, and it has been something that has persisted for years - I apparently won't outgrow it with time. It never lasts long when it does happen however.

I know a lot of people mention clarity, I don't get that, drinking black coffee in the morning makes me very energetic as opposed to having black coffee with breakfast. In a fasted state coffee will sometimes give me jitters, but I do still remain productive at work.

For me it's been a tool to keep from gaining unwanted weight, and it's got a simplicity to it in that you plan on one meal every day - so I've just kept with it. My eating window is always about 2 hours, which allows me to break my fast with a snack (veggies and hummus usually) while I make dinner for the family and then eat that dinner.

"## My Experience with Intermittent Fasting

**During my weight loss, I have also tried intermittent fasting.**   


I would simply skip breakfast, and start eating around noon. I would eat a big lunch, couple of small snacks, and a medium size dinner. I would stop eating completely by 8pm.  


In the beginning, it was very hard to do intermittent fasting. I would feel very hungry by 10am and I would have trouble concentrating on my work until lunch time. I would literally count the minutes until lunch.   


**Once I break my lunch, it was very enjoyable and I would have no problems sticking to my calorie needs.** 

After a week or two, the hunger stopped being an issue. My body adopted to the way I eat and I could easily wait until noon to eat.  


Around a month mark, I would notice I didn’t feel that hungry even at noon. On the weekends, I was able to push my lunch as late as 3pm. As long as I found something to distract myself, I could go for 18-20 hours without consuming any calories.  


Sparkling water and black coffee helped to suppress my appetite. On the days where I felt hungry and wanted to push even further, drinking a cup of bone broth helped reducing my cravings and hunger. I could just eat 1 huge meal and go for 22-23 hours by only drinking bone broth.  


Results of my intermittent fasting was not much better than the times I are around the clock. However, it was much easier to stay in a calorie deficit. I would even eat more just to meet my macro needs even if I didn’t feel hungry.

"Intermittent Fasting. It’s in the name, really. You don’t do it everyday. You only do it intermittently. 

Don’t confuse IF with time-restricted eating (TRE) although they are similar, in theory. 

A fast is no caloric consumption. Period. Typically speaking, coffee, amino acids and water (d’uh) are okay because they won’t break your fast (I.e. not enough calories to push your body out of the fasted state that you’ve created). The main goal of IF is typically to keep insulin levels low and the introduction of calories kicks insulin release switch to “on”. 

For me, I find that TRE is a little different. I start my day with a coffee, usually with a tbsp of MCT oil or butter in a pinch. My first meal is around noon or 1pm and dinner is after my workout around 7:00pm or so. 

If I decide to have a day where I’m doing IF then my first meal isn’t until 4:00 of 5:00pm and my last meal is still around 7:00pm.",-0.5106,0.012,0.95,0.038
"I’ve been doing time restricted feeding (6-12pm) IF for a couple weeks now. Initially, I started  it for productivity purposes. I’m a student in school and working and making time in my day to stop for food was just a major problem.
1. Because stopping to buy food hits my wallet too hard
2. Meal prepping and making time to get to it throughout the day also proved to be a pretty big challenge
I typically try to work out at 5 so I can break my fast right when I finish which has worked very well for me so far.

Despite doing it just to clear up my daytime to grind, I’ve also noticed an increasingly clear headspace, specifically towards the end of the day before I end my fast which used to be the time that everything got the most fuzzy for me to work through. Besides that, my energy levels are much more consistent throughout the day and willpower comes very easily now. This also all while operating on less sleep (about 7 hours a night) than I’m normally comfortable with and not for timer restriction reasons. I value sleep a lot and typically try to hit 8 hours, but since I’ve started I struggle sleeping more than 7 because I don’t feel as tired in the morning. Also, coffee and tea, caffeinated or not, are great assistants for me getting through the hunger to start the day. Additionally, caffeine encourages the mobilization of free fatty acids and will help you shift your energy source from glycogen/glucose a little bit faster and smother.

Towards the health effects: With me there were no bad side effects, otherwise I guess I'd have noticed after three years! :-D In fact I really enjoyed eating with a calm, conscious and relaxed mind in the late evening when the stress of the day has vanished. So I really liked that I could be present during this ""eating window"". Nonetheless I had to give it up because I am a very skinny and thin person. I want to gain weight so fasting is obviously not the best tactics to pursue this goal.

Nonetheless I miss it now and then because I felt my body having 16 hours time to digest everything and was empty felt like a detoxing or almost daily cleansing process. Moreover I feel that eating throughout a stressful day is nothing I enjoy but more of a necessaty whereas in the evening there is now stress, there are no duties and you can really enjoy every bite you take and be mindful with what you eat.

Overall I can really recommend it if you have a busy schedule. But I really warn you: People who are either naturally thin, tend to fixate on their body statue or even have a history with eating disorders should not try intermittent fasting since it might exacerbate these problems.",-0.8844,0.064,0.835,0.1
"When I was in college, I did a paper/project on Intermittent Fasting and then one on the Spartan lifestyle. I honestly loved IF, it made me feel less emotional in the mornings when my body got used to the idea. I started to look forward to meals rather than feeling like eating was a chore. I feel like it helped my mental stability as well as forming better habits. Knowing I wasn’t eating for a while, I would drink plenty of water and was able to work out with less intensity to keep up with my caloric intake on those days.

I used to have a huge overeating problem with my obsession with working out. I used to powerlift and push my body to unhealthy limits, which coincided with eating huge portions to keep up with my energy levels. The problem with it was that I would get injured a lot and have to take breaks, but I’d still eat the same. This led to my stress and depression to take over and made me stop eating. So I took the Advanced Nutrition class at my local college and took it upon myself to write my final paper on Intermittent fasting.

Instead of using multiple cases of research, I decided to base part of the paper on my personal experience with it. and two of my friends who wanted to try it. It honestly improved my life, my mental health, and my overall enjoyment in life. After a while, I started to make really bad life decisions which took away from my personal health and I stopped properly dieting.

That was pretty easily resolved by salting my water a little more and my food a little less.

"It's been a battle and the only thing that worked in the end and now I love it because of how much time I save and it feels great not eating and not feeling so compelled to eat. It's an experience I didn't understand and now, having a sense of control over something my whole family and many friends struggle with feels very empowering. I've lost a bunch of weight, I feel healthier, stronger and more limber. I guess time will tell whether or not it was healthy or not :)

There are downsides. I feel pukey/nauseous most of the time but it's more of a minor annoyance and leads to a bit of awkwardness at times.


Another bad thing is that eating is something I have to control and has become less a social thing, or thing I enjoy and I think that's important too but I think right now it's better to further discipline myself. My overall portions are also shrinking, even when I snack, the amount I snack is less and it's easier to make healthy choices. If there was bread in the cupboard, it's easy to grab it, put butter on it. It's just as easy to grab a carrot, give it a wash and eat it.

The diet I'm trying to follow is a cross between an [IBS](https://www.ibsdiets.org/fodmap-diet/fodmap-food-list/) which is something I incorporated recently and my old [Kidney stone](https://www.upmc.com/-/media/upmc/patients-visitors/education/unique-pdfs/low-oxalate-diet.pdf) diet. I've been kind of stumbling towards the IBS diet after adopting the kidney stone diet. Testing foods and seeing how my stomach reacts. Confirming when I eatout and I eat something that doesn't agree with my stomach that it's a problem. It's been a process that's lead to a substantial quality of life increase.

If you don’t feel like it though, in a nutshell, it’s an amazing tool for helping people who are otherwise unsuccessful at controlling calories to lose weight by 1 mechanism and 1 mechanism only, creating a caloric deficit. IF is NOT magic, despite what some people will claim. Do not fall for these falsehoods. 

While you will see many anecdotal stories on here and many other places including myself at certain points in my life of using this tool where it has been successful, seek to understand why it was successful as opposed to falling for wonderfully written stories or the promise of gigantic, crazy large meals and a shredded 8 pack. 

IF works, absolutely, because it helps control calories. It does NOT speed up metabolism, it does NOT increase muscle anabolism, and it does NOT increase testosterone levels along with NOT doing many other magical things some people claim it to do. It is also in no way superior to fat loss than a calorically restricted diet (which it is in and of itself anyways...). 

Personally, I fast maybe 1-2 days a week. I found when I did it I felt like shit, had trouble sleeping, and couldn’t control my hunger once I broke the fast. I did 16/8, 18,6, 20/4 at various points in my life and for at least 2-3 months at a time so the “not giving it enough time” argument holds no weight. If your having trouble losing weight, sure maybe give it a try but understand if it works for you, it’s because it helps you create a caloric deficit and nothing more which brings up an important point, if your having trouble losing weight or your simply not but are trying to, it’s because your not in a caloric deficit. If I were you and that’s the issue, I would seek to understand why that is first before attempting a dietary pattern change.",-0.8029,0.1,0.772,0.128

At the same time go exercise 3-5 days a week. Don’t just do cardio, lift weights. You’ll be surprised how far it will get. 

Personally, I eat 3 meals a day, with snacks (healthy) in between each meal, and I never gain fat. It’s all about cutting the crappy stuff out, the candy, the chocolate, fried food. You can have a cheat meal once a week, but no more.

"Interesting question.  Here are my thoughts:

There is some conflicting data around fasting; there are some older observational studies that suggest that those who skip breakfast do not do as well as those who eat breakfast, and there are some newer studies that show good results with intermittent fasting. 

My opinion is that the results that you get are going to depend highly on the base diet. 

If you are on a high-carb/low-fat diet, your metabolism is mostly going to be fueled by glucose. After you stop eating at night, your blood glucose is supported primarily by the glycogen stores in your liver, which holds about 100 grams or 400 calories. You aren't using a ton of calories while you sleep, but you are using enough to deplete the liver glycogen store, which makes you hungry when you wake up. If you skip breakfast and make it until lunch, you are likely to be \*famished\* because of your low glycogen stores, which means you are more likely to overeat. 

If you are on a low-carb diet, your metabolism shifts to be fueled mostly from fat. That means that overnight, you are burning mostly fat so you burn less glucose and therefore your glycogen stores are fuller. Further, the fat in our bodies is stored as triglycerides; this is a glycerol molecule with 3 fatty acids attached to it. When we burn the fatty acids for fuel, that leaves a leftover glycerol molecule, and that feeds into gluconeogenesis, which creates new glucose.  The result is that you are less hungry when you wake up in the morning and skipping breakfast is pretty simple; you just keep on burning fat. I'm a cyclist and I fairly regularly skip breakfast and go for a 3 hour bike ride, and then come back and eat a normal lunch. That bike ride is about 1500 calories, but I'm not particularly hungry because I'm burning mostly fat. 

WRT more meals, I think the idea there was that if you get smaller doses of food, you will see smaller spikes in blood glucose. That seems like a good thing, but it's not clear to me whether it actually works out or not. I found one recent paper [here](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1002.8486&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

"The major reason why IF is so popular is because it brings your hormones back in check. This is especially true for people trying to lose weight or have type 2 diabetes. Eating 5 small meals a day of carbs or protein means your insulin is going to go up. Insulin directly inhibits hormones that break down fat making weight lost slower when eating more often. The goal of IF isn't to starve yourself of calories but to restrict when you eat so your body's hormones can normalize.

I personally enjoy IF because it allows me not to think about food until I break my fast. That means I don't have as much of a guilty conscious during the day from what I may eat. Neither do I have to make decisions all day of what I'm going to eat. The simplistic idea of IF is what makes it easy to mantain as well. It's more of a lifestyle than a diet.

"As far as I’m aware a lot of the science behind the “eat many small meals” was based upon somewhat questionable hypotheses arguing that hunger wouldn’t have enough time to “build up” and it would result in less aggregate food consumption over time. 

The principal problem with that science is that it takes a rather myopic view of the homeostatic function associated with regulation of hunger/satiety and would be irrelevant should there exist any satiety function which worked over a time span longer than a few hours. For example, if a meal had the ability to satiate someone on timescale of 12 hours or multiple days. 

Further, should an alternate hypothesis of weight management like the carbohydrate-insulin model prove to be correct, it would imply that such a consumption pattern may well be deleterious. 

People also argue, not unreasonably, that there are benefits to time restricted feeding or short fasts. It seems unlikely, given our understanding of how hunter gatherers functioned, that the “many small meals” consumption pattern dominated in prehistoric times. ",-0.5918,0.053,0.867,0.08

They talk about different people who are trying to achieve different results and that is why there is no one proper answer or diet.  The one thing I have learned is there are a ton of people doing great with fasting, myself included.  But as with most things in life, some people have to go overboard.  3 day fasts are amazing?  Well then 30 days should be 10 times better!  This is not the case.  Some people have done it, and were successful, but it really is not the point of it.  The key is insulin.  You either have it and your body reacts one way (uses glucose, stores fat) or you have no insulin, you get into ketosis and a bunch of other hormones ramp up like HGH and eventually autophagy and gets all its energy from fat stores.  After a while when your body gets used to making the switch, your body simply has the ability to effortlessly access any energy available.

Another point I am not sure that was made, but the one most common misconception about fasting is it will slow your TDEE (calories you use in a day no matter what), but this has been proven to not only be false, but you actually use more energy on days you fast if you only do it occasionally.  I eat every other day some weeks (still trying to lose that last 30) and I make sure on my feast days to consume 2k plus calories.  This means on my fast days, I still burn the regular amount.  This is the main reason the traditional calorie restriction diets fail is your body will slow down its TDEE to match the incoming food.  Eventually, once you start eating again, your body still is only using the reduced amount so the extra calories go right back into storage, especially with high insulin response based diets.

"I'm sort of an accidental intermittent faster and I would say it works for me.  I'm a very small person (95lbs, 5'3"") and so it's really easy for me to accidentally overeat at lunch, which makes me really, really tired and it's so hard to focus.

If I plan on lunch, all I can think about in the beginning of the day is the lunch I brought or where I plan to eat for lunch, and then I'm tired after eating.  I work much better totally eliminating lunch from the things I have to think about, and just work straight through my day.  Of course, sometimes I do still eat lunch, like when I have a meeting or a catered thing or whatever.

During group based discussion, my professors have pointed to a lot of studies that are inconclusive. The main reason for this is that we need to see the long-term effects of such a dietary pattern on things such as Enzyme profile, hormone levels, metabolic changes. 
These all take months to years to completely change and adapt to a certain eating pattern. 

Another issue we've discussed is the guidelines surrounding what is, and isn't, considering intermittent fasting. 
Those who are very extreme with it will not be able to maintain it long term given the stress it causes on the body and the mental strain of trying to restrict one's self so much (in extreme cases I'm referring. Not all.) 

Finally, I think the biggest thing to consider when deciding whether an eating pattern is considered ""good"" or ""bad"" is to see how much variety you can fit into that window. 

If you're going to practice intermittent fasting, are you going to consume coupious amounts of fast food when allowed to eat? Are you going to consume high calorie- low nutrient dense foods?

>The body may be able to store a total of only 400-600 grams of carbohydrates in the liver and muscle.  This amounts to about 1600-2400 kcal (4 kcal per gram of carbohydrate) depending on body size, time of day, and dietary intake.  Although 1600-2400 kcals sounds like a lot, it should be noted that **only about 400-500 kcals are actually directly available to be used for maintaining blood glucose levels.**  The remaining 1200-1900 calories from glycogen are found in the muscle cells, which are very stingy about sharing their glycogen.  In other words, muscle cells are not capable of releasing stored glucose directly into the bloodstream.  Unlike in liver cells, which can release glucose back into the blood to help to maintain glucose levels between meals, once glucose is taken into the muscle cell, it cannot be directly released back into the bloodstream.  Therefore, **once the liver is depleted of glycogen, blood glucose levels begin to decrease.**

12-16 hours is a reasonable time to estimate for *the beginning* of gluconeogensis and ketone production, but I wouldn't say that your body is fully fat-adapted at that point.  Ketones generally rise slowly in the blood and peak over a period of a few days.",0.3513,0.028,0.955,0.017

At a given point, your body has an amount of glucose that it wants and the amount that is available through diet. If the amount it needs is greater than the amount in the diet, you will adapt through one or more of the following:

1. Switching from glucose metabolism to fat metabolism for the tissues that can use either.
2. Gluconeogenesis to create glucose.
3. Ketone production to that the place of glucose for tissues that can use either glucose or ketones.

How these are mixed depends on how low the carbs are and how long the lack of carbs has persisted. 

People who are in ketosis will still have reasonable glycogen stores; the studies on keto athletes show that their muscle glycogen stores really aren't much different than those in athletes who eat high carb diets.

As for the app, whether you reach ketosis during intermittent fasting is going to depend on what you are eating. If you are on a keto diet, then you are in ketosis for the vast majority of the time regardless of when you have eating. If you are on a low-fat/high-carb diet, you may not reach ketosis at all during intermittent fasting, though you may be burning quite a bit of fat during that period. And if you're in between, maybe you hit ketosis, maybe you don't.

Fat is the preferred fuel source of the human body until you begin exercising at high intensity. From rest to moderate intensity exercise humans burn more fat than carbs. You do not need to be in ketosis to burn fat

Indeed there are people who gain some muscle at TDEE with intermittent fasting. Check r/leangains: you are giving your body all it needs including a proper training to trigger muscle growth so you are cutting some fat and intermittent fasting helps with this because you are free from insulin spikes most of the day and your body is bound to use fat for fuel.

"I'll give it a try...

The amount of fat and carbs that you burn are controlled by how available carbs are to your metabolism. 

If you eat a very low fat high carb diet and you eat often, you will spend the majority of your time in a state where glucose there is lots of available glucose - when blood glucose is raise, you have more glucose than you want. That means that most of your energy comes from that stored glucose, and little comes from stored fat. 

There are just starting to be studies where they do continuous glucose monitoring of people, and the results have been interesting. Here's one [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2769652/). If you look at Figure 2, you will see that there are big spikes in glucose at each of the meals, and the glucose levels remain high until about the time of the next meal. There is raised glucose for perhaps 15 hours, leaving normal glucose levels only during the night, maybe 9 hours max.

Raised glucose means raised insulin, and raised insulin means little or no fat burning. So, these people only have the opportunity to burn fat for about 9 hours during the time when their glucose is low. Note that this study is done with people who are \*healthy\*; they don't have prediabetes or type II diabetes. 

Intermittent fasting is really about extending that period. If you skip breakfast, you will add another 4 hours to the time in which you are in a good state to burn fat, and that time right before eating is when you are best at burning fat. You will also - over time - push your body to be better at burning fat during that overnight period. 

The obvious question is ""will you just eat more at lunch to make up for what you didn't eat at breakfast?""

Hunger is a really complex thing, but one of the thing that influences it is blood glucose levels, but we can see from the graph that people have very stable blood glucose levels before breakfast, and that seems to carry on to lunch. Those who intermittent fast seem to eat a bit more at lunch but not enough to make up for what they didn't eat at breakfast. At least those who are carrying excess fat seem to do this. 

To get to your question about muscle building, it's an interesting question. The papers that I have read suggest that protein before or immediately after resistance exercise improve muscle protein synthesis, but it's not clear how that relates to actual muscle gain.

Realistically, many people who do intermittent fasting eat after their exercise, and that's probably good enough to get the benefit that you want. ",0.9808,0.08,0.9,0.019

"Many religious cultures employ fasting as part of their daily lives. For example, the Coptic orthodox religions recommend a fasting diet (for spiritual reasons). The fasting is a strict vegan diet (no meat or dairy products). For those who choose to, there are even time restrictions regarding when one can eat. Many practitioners of these types of fasting claim that there are health benefits. Western science is now seeing the benefits of such fasting through research. An example of such research is below (the article uses the Greek orthodox religion).

"Hi,

I began intermittent fasting a month ago and I really enjoy it so far. I am doing the 16/8 rule, where you fast from 20:00 to 12:00 next day and you eat between 12 and 20. 

I found that drunking herbal tea during mornings and evenings helped me feel better and prolong the fast. I can confirm I feel fuller faster and hungry rarely since I started fasting. I am counting my calories and if I did not count them I would probably massively undereat as I get full so fast and I really don't feel hungry. I Felt that eating 2 meals a day was my best way to go and I rarely snack more than tea with milk in between. I weight train 4 times per week and Id not reccommend training during your fast as I felt light headed few times when I tried.

"I experimented with IF for 6 months.

I mostly did the 16 hour fast and 8 hour eating window. I would eat right after my workout finished at 13:00, then I would eat larger meals until around 21:00.

Basically I skipped breakfast.

The odd time I would go a full day without eating.  A complete 24-hour fast.  But that was tough to do.

I like to eat and I don't care who knows it.

In the beginning of my IF experience, I felt hungry and slightly lethargic. After a few days, my energy actually picked up, and my performance in the gym with my lifts stayed strong. I was enjoying it.

Then, at about the six-month mark, I started feeling tired and lazy again. I would get hungry and more irritable. I decided to go back to eating breakfast, and having more frequent, normal-sized meals.

Since then, I will occasionally employ this style of eating after say, a calorie-heavy weekend (let's face it, we all have those!).  

I don't get crazy if I skip a meal, or if I happen to not eat for a few hours.

**I guess the trick is to be aware of your hunger, and not letting that skipped meal lead to an all-out binge-fest the next time you eat.**

I wrote a bit more about it on my site, and you can read what I wrote here:

IF is a pretty simple and straightforward method, and your personal preference and lifestyle will be the indicators on how long you decide to fast.

Research has shown that IF can actually extend life, regulate blood sugar, manage your weight, and actually help you gain (or at least maintain) lean body mass.  It allows the body to take a break from digesting food, which can help increase insulin sensitivity while telling your body to burn more stored fat as fuel.

**There are two common ways to practice IF:  A 16 hour fast, and a 24 hour fast.**

An example of a 16 hours fast would be, say, having your first meal at 12PM, and then eating 2-3 larger meals up until 8PM, when you will start your fasting period.

When you do fast, keep in mind you can't eat anything for the fasting period.

Zero calorie drinks are allowed, however.

**How to determine if you should fast, and for how long:**

If you find yourself being mentally taxed with having to prepare meal after meal - and cart them around in containers from place to place - IF may be a nice break from the regular change of pace.  You may no longer feel tied to the clock, glued to the idea of having to eat every three hours on the dot to keep yourself fit.

IF can be freeing, in that sense.

It's a nice feeling knowing you don't have to worry about gathering a breakfast, and storing it at work, for that day.  You can spend more time prepping the later meals, or doing whatever else you may enjoy.

Now, when it comes to determining how long to fast, current research is showing that the longer fasting periods may offer you more benefits than a shorter fast.

**See, your eating and fasting windows should be determined by your activity levels.**

​For a sedentary person who struggles to get much activity in, a longer fast (20-24 hours) may be needed for maximum benefit.

For active people - or those that are exercising consistently - you may be able to enjoy the same benefits after only 16-20 hours without food.

Hope that helps clear things up for you,

"I am currently trying to get back into the swing of intermittent fasting. I did it for most of 2015 and it helped me lose 50 lbs. Because I was eating in a shorter window of time I split my daily calories of about 1500-1600 between two meals. Since the meals were larger I felt satisfied and didn't feel like a was really restricting my diet. 

I had absolutely no luck staying with IF when I worked out in the morning. I was just too hungry about an hour after my workout. Since I switched my workouts to the evenings I've been slowly pushing the time I break my fast to 1 pm. My schedule for eating in 2015 was a meal at 1 am., a light snack at about 4 if needed and a meal at 7 pam. I would have a couple cups of coffee in the morning though and I was away at 8 am. 

I find IF works really well for me because I tend to be hungry all morning if I do eat a breakfast after I wake up. It doesn't matter how large the meal is or what it consists of, I am starved within 2 hours of eating. If I don't eat, I don't really start feeling hungry until 11 am and I can usually just have a glass of water or cup of coffee until I do eat at noon or 1pm. 

What would work for me for my first meal was a whole grain toast and protein (peanut butter or 2-3 poached eggs) or steal cut oatmeal with protein or poached eggs. Savoury oatmeal is da bomb by the way. So good. My second meal was larger and consisted of some kind of protein (chicken, soy, eggs, etc), pasta or brown rice or sweet potato and a whole lot of vegetables.

I eat my dinner at around 4:30, or later sometimes if it's busy at work and I can't find time to eat right then. 

I personally don't skip any meals, I just eat all my calories in the eight hour window with as many meals/snacks as I feel like. It helps immensely to have a ""no eating after 5pm"" mindset. Though if I'm going out for dinner with family/friends, I'm pretty flexible about that and just don't eat as big of a lunch, or at all. That's the only time I skip a meal though.

I also don't do a 24 hour fast. I tried it once and felt like shit and like I wanted to collapse at 18 hours, so no thanks.

I've been doing it for about a year with great results. My hunger is controllable and I don't get hangry anymore. I will say that now that I'm getting to some pretty heavy lifts (for me anyway), I eat some trail mix (mixed nuts, raisins, coconut shavings, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds) about an hour or two before bed the night before lifting days (9-10pm) just to give my muscles a little more fuel for the morning, but only about a tablespoon of the mix.. calories for that are tracked too though.

So I guess that's kinda cheating IF, but I just felt so crappy some days and my lifts were suffering so a small change/cheat like that is okay for me. I think it's recommend to take BCAAs in the morning if you're lifting heavy fasted, but I'm broke and don't want to buy the supplements, so this is my compromise. ",-0.7769,0.086,0.823,0.091

I skip breakfast, though I always have herbal tea, to hydrate, and black coffee. I often work out first thing in the morning and I always have interesting work to do. If you don't have things to do, I think it will be harder not to eat. 

It's a pleasure not to have to think about preparing a meal in the morning. If I get hungry, I drink some water - it still surprises me how often that takes care of any hunger.

I'm not strict about eating - we may have evolved to eat a lot in a small time frame, but if my husband wants to go out to breakfast once a month or so, I'm all in. Depending on my schedule, I have a big meal somewhere between 11 and 2. 

One thing to keep in mind is that you should have 3 hours or so after your last meal, before you go to sleep. It may not be an issue for you now, but as you age it's very important.

"Started this in January after many failed diets/workouts. I'm 5'9 and at about 210lbs now, but when I started I was around 240lbs. I stuck to my calorie limit (I was running a deficit since I wanted to lose the weight) and only ate between 1pm and 9pm. I don't do breakfast, but if you do, feel free to. I worked out around 7am because I was led to understand that my body was fully fasted and would be burning fat for energy at this point. I am by no means an expert but this worked well for me and I continue to do this now. 

It is much harder to keep this up on the weekends when friends want to go out and eat at all of hours of the night but I do my best to stick to it during the week and that is enough for me. Tailor this as best you can to your schedule, but be prepared for some very inconvenient hungers as it takes some time to adjust to it.

I start eating around 13:00, after I workout, stop eating at 18:00, go to bed around 20:00. I work early in the morning so it'll differ from most people.


I break fast with some eggs, these are pretty light and an easy opener for the stomach if yours tends to get upset easy, other then that just make sure you eat enough, or at a deficit, to get to the point you want. The one thing that I find hard is to eat enough to gain weight as its pretty hard to consume 3000~ calories in a couple of hours, though your body does adapt to eating more food in shorter amounts of time.

Furthermore, I only got hunger in the first 1 or 2 days, after that it feels fine unless I've barely eaten the previous day.

Quick run down:

There are a multitude of [hormonal effects](https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/biggest-loser-diet-explained/) that occur when fasting that don't occur with just a calorie deficit.

>As you fast, there are a number of hormonal changes that do NOT happen with simple caloric reduction. Your body senses that you are getting no food. Growth hormone surges. Noradrenalin surges. Insulin drops. These are so called counter-regulatory hormones that are natural reactions to fasting. They keep blood glucose normal. Growth hormones maintain lean mass. Noradrenalin keeps basal metabolism high.

That's not the normal way to follow IF.  In IF you skip breakfast and maybe lunch.  For example I eat from 5-10pm.  You aren't suppose to eat Dinner and Breakfast, that defeats the purpose.  a 12-14 hour gap is incorrect.  You want a 18-20hour gap.

>However, my appetite is such that if I eat until I feel full

How do you normally eat?  If you usually eat 2,500 calories a day, but now you consume 1,500 a day, you're going to be hungry.  You aren't eating enough.  It doesn't matter how high quality your food is if you aren't eating enough **you will be hungry no matter what**.  

>it's not like I'm eating refined carbs for dinner

Even if you ate refined carbs for dinner, such as white rice, pasta or tortillas, you won't be hungry the next day if you are doing it right.  Avoiding refined carbs isn't going to do anything for you when it comes to appetite.  **Total calories is what matters here.**  

You need to calculate how much calories you burn a day and go from here.  A normal person will burn 2,000-2,500 a day.  I burn 2,500.  I am cutting atm so my goal is 2,000 a day to lose weight.  If I eat 2,000 I won't be hungry, if I eat 1,500 I'll be starving.  

For example I practice **carb cycling** and **Intermittent fasting**.  My goal is 1.5g of protein per kg, so 180 pounds is 82kg which is 123g protein(roughly 500 calories).  My goal for fat is 35% calories from fat, so on a 2,000 calorie diet(500 calorie deficit), I need 700 calories from fat 78g.  700 calories+500=1200 calories.  I have 800 remaining for carbs which is 200g carbs.

**200g carbs**

**125g protein**

**80g fats**

That would be my daily diet goals for a 2,000 calorie cutting diet.  That keeps me full during the fasting periods(18-20 hour fasts).  

Now the way I **carb cycle** is that on workout days MWF I simply eat 2,750 calories without increasing my fat intake.  That means those extra 750 calories are coming from carbs.  That means an extra 188g carbs.

**388g carbs**

**125g protein**

**80g fats**

Start the **feast** after working out.  The reason I **carb cycle** is because it's nice, psycologically, to eat high carb a few days a week.  That means those days I can eat my enchiladas(tortilla/chicken breast), i can eat extra rice or potatoes, I can eat more popcorn..etc.  It works out for my life because I can pig out during social dinners and when my wife wants to cook an unhealthy meal.

"I'm not sure that method really works timewise. I think the point of IF is you fast for certain hours everyday.

From what I've read and practised myself (I stopped as I found it difficult to eat enough around my job and it was incredibly restricting for someone who loves breakfast) choose a feeding window such as 12-8 and stick with that everyday.

"I generally say that nutrition research is a hot mess...

Problem 1 is that much of the advice out there is based on observational studies that use food frequency questionnaires. 

Observational studies \*in general\* are problematic; because they are not randomized, what you are measuring is not the specific difference you are looking at between two groups - how much meat they ate, for example - but the sum total of all the differences between people who ate a lot of meat and those who didn't. To help remove the influence of these confounders, researchers do corrections to try to eliminate them, but you can never be sure that there aren't hidden confounders that remain - the [healthy user effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3077477/) is a big one. 

This is why when you look at papers based on observational studies, they always say ""associated with"" - one cannot conclude causality except in extraordinary cases. 

And the data going into the studies from the questionnaires is not good; here's a paper that concludes that they are [pseudoscience](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0895435617313756). 

For more on this, I highly recommend reading [the work of John Ioannidis](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article%3Fid%3D10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124).

So my first advice is to flat out ignore anything observational, and the researchers and popularizers who either do not know what associations show or do not care. 

Problem 2 is that there are many people who have vested interests in a specific way of eating. There are those who are philosophically or religiously against eating meat, and worse, there are those who are in the business of turning commodity foodstuffs - wheat, corn, vegetable oil, and sugar - into value-adding processed foods that can be sold at a high margin. The latter group unfortunately has a \*lot\* of money and has deployed it to improve their business model; that is why we see very few commercials for whole foods and vast numbers of commercials for processed foods. 

The solution here is to read widely and follow the money. 

Beyond that, we can learn a lot from RCTs. They are by no means perfect and are inherently limited, but they give us better data than we know.

For this, you will have to read widely. Read Teicholz' ""the big fat surprise"", and then go back and read the minnesota coronary experiment and the sydney heart study recovered data studies. 

WRT the article in general, I don't find it very compelling; complaining that there is no strict definition for what is processed ignores pretty obvious that a steak is not processed and a bag of Ruffles or a bag of oreos clearly is. This is honestly not rocket science.",0.2454,0.087,0.821,0.092

"Fasting is the one common theme between all religions and basically every culture. If your into evolutionary biology, our ancestors never had access to an unlimited supply of food. Not every hunt was successful; there was no unlimited access to food and all day snacking. 

Food quality is one issue, but the majority of people exceed their body’s energy demands. Most people eat like they’re running daily marathons yet rarely get out of the seated position. 

Just to clarify, 16:8, 20:4 are routines I would call time restricted eating. Fasting is where you go multiple days without food and to be quite frank the term is way overused. 

The benefits are immense: autophagy, a humongous rise in HGH, an increase in BDNF, reduction in inflammation, helpful with autoimmune conditions, good for weight loss, boosts stem cell production and helps the immune system to name a few. 

Another benefit someone mentioned is the digestive system. Most people have no clue the amount of energy it takes to digest food. Once your ghrelin  levels drop around day 3, hunger goes and you should be in a prime fat burning state. If you have adequate body fat (over 15-20 at least), your energy levels will be amazing. Your naturally burning fat for fuel after a few days, so to feel good and have success on a longer fast do a ketogenic diet before. That way your fat adapted and your body can use fat efficiently. Also top up on magnesium, potassium and salt throughout a longer fast. 

Lastly, head over to the fasting subreddit. There’s lots of good info on studies and such but you have to use the search tool. 90% of the content on there is about weight loss. Hope this helps.

"Fasting offers a lot of health benefits, which have been documents (lower risk of cancer, lower blood pressure, better cholesterol Taos, controlled blood sugar levels, fat loss, lower inflammation, increased neurogenesis aka brain cell growth, etc!) 

BUT it’s not great for EVERYONE. When done properly and in the right context it is, but from some people fasting is a bad idea. 

If you are obese or not in normal to good health it could not be your best option. Sure, it promotes fat loss but that doesn’t make it a fat loss tool. If you have a damaged metabolism, fasting may hurt you more than help you (slowing your metabolism even more).

When you fast it puts stress on your body, putting you in fight or flight mode - if your body is already under lots of stress or your metabolism has adapted to become slow (due to over exercising/dieting) then you’ll make things worse. 

If your diet, exercise, and sleep aren’t doing well then fasting should probably not be a priority. It just shouldn’t be the top fo your list. 

If you’re over 18, not pregnant, healthy with good fitness, nutrition, and sleep practices then you can been fit from fasting. 

There is the common 16/8 eating structure. And then there are other approaches that fit different lifestyles.

There are less frequent, longer fasts. Some do 24hr fasts every 1-2 weeks, 48hr fasts every 2-4 weeks, or even 3 day fasts every 1-3 months. Which can actually have more been fits than the 16/8. That’s because when you’re fasting, once your body burns through all of the fuel from food that you have ingested in the last few days, it looks for nourishment in any way it can get it. One of these places that it finds nourishment is in your fat cells, so fasting can help a little with weight loss (though 90% of the weight you lose on a long term fast will be from water weight that will be gained back immediately). BUT your body also finds nourishment from breaking down damaged, malfunctioning cells in your body, a process called autophagy. When you end your fast and refers your body, it uses that nourishment to rebuild these cells, essentially regenerating parts of your body.

Fast for just three days can regenerate the immune system as well as reduce autoimmunity. Pretty damn cool huh? 

Then their is the Warrior Diet, where you eat in a 4-hour period. You can look it up. 

Other methods are different due to caloric undulation. All depends on what you feel works best with your schedule, health, and goals. 

Just remember that not eve  try healthy thing works for everyone. So if you try it out and experience any negative symptoms, it’s okay to avoid fasting! But if you have that healthy lifestyle I talked about, it is worth testing out one or all types to find your fit.

Capsaicin (the active compound in hot peppers) directly interacts with nerve receptors for heat. One can have the sensation of intense heat without acid or local inflammation.

Dietary acids will have a small effect on total acid present in your stomach. Distilled vinegar is pH 2.4, gastric acid pH normally ranges from 0.5 to 2. It's a log10 scale so the gastric acid is commonly 10 times as acidic.

"Coming from a Registered Dietitian... Not sure if you are male or female and how old you are so I am going to throw out just general info that may help you.

1. As far a quantity throughout the day: Fruit- 2 cups. This could be one 8oz cup of 100% orange juice and a medium sized apple a day for example. Veggies- 3 cups An example for the day: 1 cup of cooked broccoli, 2 cups of leafy green salad mix (2cups leaves= 1 cup veggie), and 12 baby carrots. Grains- 6oz To give you an idea of an oz= 1 slice of bread or 1 cup of cereal or1/2 cup of past, rice, and oatmeal. In the US not many people eat whole grains and typically eat refined grains (ie ""white"" grains) so the goal is to eat at least 3 oz whole grains and 3 oz of refined grains. To know if a grain is whole grain the first ingredient will be ""whole wheat""  or ""whole grain"". Also brown rice, whole wheat pasta, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, bulgar are all whole grains. Proteins: about 6oz total for the day. This oz measurement is for the weight of the meat. If you don't want to weigh your foods closely, 4 oz is about the size of a full deck of cards. 1 egg = 1 oz, 1/4 cup of cook beans = 1 oz, and 2 Tbsp of hummus. Oils- 6 teaspoons a day of healthy oils which are plant oils ( olive, soybean, sunflower, safflower) as well as nuts, fish, and salad dressings. This includes the oils you cook with, so if you are doing a stir fry keep track of how much oil you are adding to the pan. If you usually use butter or margarine look into switching to plant oils. Obviously you won't be drinking oil by the spoonful but it is important to be mindful of what types of fat you are using. Good fat = oil = liquid at room temp, bad fat = solid = solid at room temp. Finally water/fluid: add lemon or other fruits to ""spice""it up! Drink when you are thirsty. Try to avoid sugary drinks such as soda and large creamy sugary lattes at Starbucks. this plate doesn't have dairy but I think dairy is important as well but it can technically go into the protein section. 
2. The way that I look at it is I try to get at least 3 of the food groups into each main meal and at least 2 food groups for snacks. So for me that is a typical breakfast, lunch and dinner with 2-3 snacks. This just what I do, your day of food may look a lot different but it may give you idea of how to incorporate the concept. My breakfast may consist of 2 eggs (protein)scrambled with mixed with veggies such as spinach, broccoli, and zucchini (veggies) and a slice of toast (grain). You can add a glass of juice to give you a fourth food group as well. My snacks usually consists of a a fruit and protein (apple and peanut butter) or grain and protein (cheese and crackers). Lunch may be a BLT sandwich you get the grain in the bread, veggies in the lettuce and a small amount of protein in the bacon. I'll most likely have a side of baby carrots (veggies) and hummus (protein) and sun chips (grain). Finally, a dinner of pizza! Whole wheat crust = grain, sauce and green peppers and a side salad = veggies, pepperoni and cheese = protein. For dessert or before bed snack: vanilla Greek yogurt and fresh blue berries = protein and fruit. So remember every meal doesn't have to look like the plate, air for at least 3 food groups per big meal and at least 2 food groups per snack. I am skipping the intermittent fasting question cause I am not a proponent of it. 
3. Fruits and veggies: there is no one that is better than the other. They all have their unique nutritional qualities. Even potatoes are good for you! They are full of potassium (more than a banana), vitamin C (half your daily value needed), fiber (helps you poo!), and antioxidants! As far as fruits and veggies what ever taste good to you, is going to be the best for your body. Don't force yourself to eat broccoli if you hate it, its not worth it. Again with whole grains: look for the word ""whole"" as the first ingredient. 
4. Eggs would be considered a protein. Some other protein foods include: fish, meats, beans, peas, lentils, and nuts.

2. It doesn't really matter when you eat, or how often. Effects, if any, would be marginal. Fruits are easy to get in as between-meal snacks.

3.

"The best results I've heard of around PCOS are from a low carb, low GI regimen, so I think you are on the right track.

From a biochemical perspective, eating more often would reduce the size of the spikes but it would likely extend the time during which glucose - and insulin - are elevated, which would reduce the time when fat could be burned. I don't think it's a clear win one way or the other, and I don't know of any good research that has looked at this.

From an insulin perspective, what you eat is many times more important than how often you eat. If you eat a low carb diet, you simply aren't going to generate a lot of insulin in a metabolically damaged way.

There's a caveat there; eating protein also leads to higher insulin, because insulin is a general-purpose storage hormone. But with protein and few carbs, you also end up with a spike of glucagon and that changes the action of insulin radically - when people talk about insulin having a function all of the functions related to blood glucose and conversion to fat are sensitive not to insulin but to the insulin/glucagon ratio. 

I've been eating low carb for quite a while and I found that some mornings I wake up and I'm just not hungry. And those mornings I generally skip breakfast. So maybe just pay attention to how you feel and give it a try if it feels right. 

As for the value of intermittent fasting - or even alternate-day fasting - the goal is that during the fasting time, you are in a very metabolically stable state, and that is when good things happen; you can burn more fat, and autophagy is improved. 

I'd also recommend regular exercise if you aren't already getting it. Doesn't have to be intense to see a difference. 

Finally, take a trip over to [marksdailyapple.com](https://marksdailyapple.com/;); he posts success stories and I'm sure that there are a few related to PCOS.

That said I also have PCOS, if you look at that sub, you probably have noticed that many women reported doing well with keto or low carb in general because the insulin resistance often brings about hyperinsulinemia(high amounts of insulin) so in the beginning best to allow insulin levels to be reduced. Both intermittent fasting and low carb work on that. There is a lot of research that insulin affects the hypothalamus-pituitary axis and the resultant effects on the sex hormones in particular testosterone that causes PCOS and its symptoms(infertility, cysts, hirsutism etc). 

I personally have success with very low carb first than I incooperated the 16:8 intermittent fasting. They worked very well together and I am currently asymptomatic.

">Theres varying information out there about intermittent fasting, weight loss, etc etc and I am so confused. Some sources say eating frequent, or three meals throughout the day helps insulin resistance because it controls spikes, some say eating one or two large meals in a day is more helpful for insulin resistance. Which is it?

It's pretty much 'the sky is blue' territory to say that fasting helps chronic insulin resistance. If this causes blood sugar spikes to get into dangerous territory, it's best to just adjust composition so you're not taking in more carbs than you can handle.

>And what is more important in controlling insulin, what you eat or how often and when you eat?

What and how much are the biggest factors. How often is also significant. When doesn't matter much. Eat fewer carbs, eat less than maintenance overall, and spend some time running on stored energy.

>I am trying to lose weight with insulin resistance but I just don't know if I'm going about it the right way because of all the conflicting information out there. I'm eating low carb, low GI fyi.

It sounds like you're going in the right direction. You don't have to stick to a set schedule or go all in to omad or even 16:8 from the start though.

"I think worrying about/trying to create the perfect diet is counter-productive, as stress correlates with a lot of health issues. 

As for a ""pretty good"" diet, base it on whole food. If you are healthy metabolically (healthy weight, good blood glucose & HbA1c, good energy) then you will likely do fine on anything from a low-ish carb/higher fat diet to a low-ish fat/higher carb diet.

They probably would survive without it, maybe even get used  to it but I think skipping breakfast wouldn't be ideal for many of them. Such people still can do IF, even 23:1, they just eat breakfast so it's really their most  important (and only) meal of the day.

But the zillion intermittent fasters who has it as a woe for a very long time and possibly for life (like me) and not eating breakfast show that it's not big deal. And if we look at it scientifically... We are humans. We don't need nutrients in every few hours. And we can get all our nutrients in a smaller eating window and it doesn't need to be in the morning. It's 12:45 here and I am nicely full and satisfied because I ate a nice lunch yesterday. My body functions as it should and everything... And trust me, my body throws a temper tantrum if it doesn't get its nutrients and I experience strong hunger, great desire for different foods, dizzyness and whatnot. I could survive many weeks without eating but my body urges me to eat very early as it's ideal for me. Well, it wants more than I should eat but I need my challenges.

Not that I'm great at doing this myself, though I generally skip at least one breakfast a week and I will sometimes do fasted exercise on the same day. 

The size of the insulin spike that you get is dependent on a) the glucose load of whatever you eat and b) the state of your glycogen stores. If you are snacking you may be eating less but your glycogen stores are more likely to already be full, so it's likely a wash. Which is why I'd rather have that longer period of lower blood glucose.

"It depends, how much damage occurs to your skeletal muscle during a training session/ training frequency / type of training / other activities.

You will hear people say 1g/lb or 1.5g/1kg to upwards of 2-2.5g/kg or even lb of body weight. These variations occur because of varying damage needing repair and enzyme activity due to training and body composition. There are studies however which have shown the amount of protein uptake is limited to a certain amount due to the rate of bolus travel through the small intestine, this may or may not influence your decision on # of meals and protein content in each meal.

As for your friend everyone is different and some people may not need as much protein to sustain muscle mass than others. 

For how much protein you should consume to reach maximum protein synthesis I would recommend eating that 1.2g per Kg mark. You can eat more however it won’t add much of a benefit and if you go ludicrously high on consumption (~300g a day) then you may see adverse effects on your kidneys.

It takes roughly 2 hours to go from a fed state to a fasted state. If you're cramming 5 meals into an 8 hour period, you're never technically leaving the fed state. While you're taking in food 5 times, you're essentially eating 1 meal drawn out over 8 hours.",0.204,0.025,0.958,0.017

Either way, both methods of eating will provide nutrients for roughly 40 hours, so long as reasonable calories are consumed.

"Salts play a crucial role in water retention (which is one reason why a sodium heavy diet can make you gain water weight), when there is little electrolytes circulating your system (mainly sodium and potassium) you will excrete more water than if you had adequate levels. A lot of people who water fast without electrolyte supplementation will notice that they urinate more often and may feel more dehydrated than usual even if they consume the same amount of water as they did when not fasting and the same can happen for those consuming low carb diets, although I'm not sure why that is. The easiest solution is to consume salt water that has sodium and potassium in it, magensium may also help, but it's not super important.

"Most of us get plenty of salt in our diet, so electrolytes aren't usually a problem. Potassium is harder to get, but if you're healthy, you won't typically be deficient. Our bodies work hard to keep our electrolytes (mainly sodium and potassium) within very narrow limits as it's crucial for things like nerve transmission. But yes, if you are low on electrolytes, your body will get rid of water to keep your blood at the right electrolyte concentration.

For keto, you can have a temporary problem when you start the diet. Since you're extremely limiting your carbs, your body will use the glycogen (carb stores) from your liver and muscles. Glycogen binds to water at a ratio of 1 part glycogen to 3-4 parts water. So if you mobilize those stores quickly, you will release a lot of water. This can cause a temporary dilution of electrolytes. As a side note, the majority of the weight lost on the keto diet in the first few days is due to water and glycogen loss from this process.

 I don't know details about IF, but I would think that as long as you're not fasting for multiple days and you're getting adequate electrolytes each day, you won't have a problem.

Keep the no about you, and then if she tries ot make it about her, redirect to how the no was solely about you.  ""*I* want to eat this/not eat that and those choices are about me and unrelated to you.  Your baking is your choice and I respect and support it, which does not mean I'm obligated to eat any of it.""  If you can't have that conversation rationally then you should think about what that might say about other issues you might have in the relationship.

I still go out and eat with them sometimes, but i am always looking at how i can deconstruct the menu and customize my food so i am not struggling  to make up later.

Does have positive effects and training while doing so also can have positive effects as well. BUT, there is a LOT of trial and error to figure out what is best for your body. I continue to do I.F. myself and I monitor how many calories I have a day, what time of the day I eat. My primary workout method is Cardio (cycling) I workout about 3-4 days a week for 90-180 minutes depending on the day (week day vs. weekend). For me I ingest about 900-1100 calories on non-workout days. and 1500-1750 on workout days. Racing weeks that gets upped to 2000/day and 2200 the day before the race. I cook and make ALL of my food and RARELY go out to eat. When I drink it's red wine only. What he's talking about in the video does work and it works well, but everybody is different and if you have the time for the trial-and-error then you don't need to spend the money. 

Now, there are a lot of people saying cardio doesn't help lose weight. That's total and complete BS. Cardio is a phased weight loss process. I'll explain:

Phase 1: You won't lose much weight here, most people I've talked to (I work for a bicycle company) lose only about 5-10lbs and some even gain weight. This makes some people think and say ""SEE! Cardio doesn't do shit to help me lose weight!"" The reason why this is happening is because your body is building muscle where it never had the muscle in the past. Remember that MUSCLE WEIGHS MORE THAN FAT.

Phase 2: You still won't lose much weight here, again maybe only a few pounds. A lot of people get frustrated here too. They think and say ""I've been patient and I'm STILL not seeing any weight loss!"". What's happening is your body is toning itself down. So what a lot of people see is their bodies are dropping dress/pant sizes, shirt sizes, tightening your belts more. But there really isn't much weight shedding.

Phase 3: This is the phase that most of your weight loss occurs, your body has built new muscle and toned itself to a new point then before. Now it's going to start burning off all of the fat that it doesn't want or need anymore. This is where you'll start dropping major weight reductions. Now I'm not saying that you'll stop building muscle or toning your body, it's actually quite the opposite, this is just the phase where losing weight is the most noticeable. 

IF YOU STICK WITH IT, then you'll definitely see major changes in your body. A good tip for you to watch how your body changes is to stand in your bathroom in your underwear and take a selfie. Then every other month do the same thing and compare your body to before you started. You'll be very surprised how much you've changed. I hope this has helped. ",0.9758,0.094,0.854,0.052

The next morning I get a phone call from my appointed trainer talking a bit of banter about my training goals but also trying to sell me yet another item (pre-workout powder) – let’s call is Step 4.

After some post-purchase doubt I started to check online for reviews and critiques.  If you Google “Is Science Based Six Pack Abs a scam”, “Is Thomas DeLauer legit” or something similar you get reams of reviews. After reading a few (as far back as page 6) something wasn’t quite right - they were all almost unconditionally positive with lots of “pros” and a few token “cons”.  It’s clear they run a big digital operation that floods review websites with positive reviews and possibly even create review sites that they control.  The ONLY place I could find balanced commentary was on Reddit.

This is a slick well-oiled industrial scale marketing machine. However, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t work. I’m committed now, so will try it and report back.  I’m 5’11’’ and 220 lbs, with above average muscle mass (weight 3x per week, cardio 1-2x). I don’t know my body fat % but am going to get it measured.

Step 2:  Accelerated Abs        Qty: 1   $95

Step 4:  EnergyPlus (Pre-Workout):   Qty: 1  $67   (1 month’s supply I know)

"Intermittent fasting (IF) can be a great method to lose weight, but in itself it won't do much. It still comes down to the foods that you're eating and the amounts, much more than the times in which you are eating them.

IF has been shown to be effective, but I would only recommend it if you can stick to it. If you are eating the same amount of food in a day it would make no difference whether you are fasting or not, it's only really recommended for appetite suppression and portion control. 

People speak about spiking insulin when eating throughout the day and having more growth hormone when fasting due to the insulin not suppressing it, but it's quite a minuscule difference, so I wouldn't get caught up about it.

At the end of the day if you think you could do IF, then give it a go. Start simple with a 16 hour fast then you could work your way up to a 20 hour one, but simply eating in a calorie deficit without IF would still be an effective method of losing weight.",0.4365,0.092,0.824,0.084

"There is no scientific evidence supporting intermittent fasting as being some boost in burning fat. It's another method of calorie restriction that works for some, and doesn't work for others. 

Dr. Layne Norton talks about this a lot. 
I am more inclined to believe a PhD in Diet & Nutrition, over someone who simply looks the part. Not that Layne Norton doesn't look the part.

"Reading all the other comments some are just damn crap by idiots who think they know what they are on about or they go over the top and confuse you even more. Try and stick to 70/30 rule! The food you eat and what time you eat makes a HUGE difference when it comes to intermittent fasting (70% rule), use myfitness pal to count the calories, fat and so on. What the guy says in the videos makes a lot of sense and it does work. I have been trying for nearly two years of losing weight and building muscle, different approaches and variations and a lot of trail and error and I am no where near 6 abs but have a good figure. The one thing you will note that train on a empty stomach NOW this can be hard if your working full time because only get the chance to hit the gym in the evening which screws with the idea of intermittent fasting as you ideally do it in the morning as you have not eaten over the night. So you have to change your eating cycle and that is a major balls ache. Also time under tension is correct, I noticed working to failure just made didn't do anything in fact made me weaker, it was not until i watch a you tube video of a pro trainer explaining why working to failure is not good for him and trail and error in the gym to work out what works for my body. Also check out videos from Athlean X this guys stuff is free and is really good, probably one of the best if not the best out there.  SO DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY on this its not worth it. The final note, your body is unique to you and will react and behave differently to everyone else, what they don`t tell you in the videos is they probably spent months like me going through trail and error before understanding what works for them. The cardio note I have heard a lot of people claim cardio does not lose wait, that is utter bollocks, you have to do HIIT with and or weight training combined, the cardio gets the blood flowing and heart stronger and burns fat but it also kills muscle growth this is why you do the weight training.

I currently can only manage to take in 140-150g per day but I’m working my way up to 150. Your numbers sound about right to me. You can’t think of it as how to simply get “pure protein”. An easier way is thinking of how to build each meal and snack around protein. So you could do a monster omelette for breakfast with eggs, Canadian bacon, low fat cheese, veggies. Aim for that meal to be about 40g of protein. Then for a snack do a protein shake and a low fat piece of cheese (aim for 30ish grams of protein). Lunch- sandwich or salad with turkey/tuna (affordable!!) for around 30/40 G protein and then maybe let dinner be focused on that chicken breast for maybe 50/60g protein and then maybbbeee try like a protein dessert?

I’d suggest starting slow and seeing what you can manage. You don’t have to start out PERFECT. When I started tracking 8 weeks ago, I felt like 100g of protein was IMPOSSIBLE. Now, I’m managing 145 just fine, nice and easy because I’ve slowly built up to it.

">Have any of you noticed any common patterns with the relationship between your diet and mood? I’m very curious, thank you.

Yes.  Food influences your mood by influencing things like dopamine, serotonin, and other hormones/neurotransmitters.  

If you eat well by getting enough nutrients, then the body should be able to utilize the nutrition and build the right chemicals that make you happy.

With that said, I perform best by avoiding simple carbs.  Proteins and fats keep me level headed, carbs make me crash.  So I typically aim for fiber rich carbs (beans, oats) that take awhile to convert to blood sugar.

I recommend you go have two meals.  One that is filled with crap, refined pasta, soda and write down how you feel right after, 5 min after, an hour after.  And have a wholesome meal with veggies, fiber, lean meat, seafood..etc.

Unless you are lactose intolerant I am intrigued to know what these negative effects are. Any moral issue (which you've implied you don't have) would of course extend to all dairy products including protein supplements.

It's fine, furthermore anything that applies to Milk is going to apply to your 'creamer' and presumably dairy based protein supplement. So if you're going to cut out the very small amount of milk you have with coffee, the you should really cut out the over stuff too.

"If you've never had any negative effects from milk I can't see a reason to avoid it. Excellent quality protein, healthy fats, cheap as fuck. I know there's a lot of milk haters out there, but I think it's driven by fighting back against the government recommendations that make it seem like dairy is an essential part of your diet. Nobody needs to drink milk or consume any dairy products at all, there's nothing in them you need that can't be gotten elsewhere easily.

If you were going to quit milk you'd want to know what thing about it was ""poison"", then you could decide if it extends to other products. If it's the proteins, then the whey protein powder you have is poison. If it's the fats, then the cream and butter is poison. If it's some hormone then it could potentially be making its way to other dairy products. Personally the endocrine disrupting compounds in soy are more worrisome to me than some weak evidence of possible increased prostate cancer risk from drinking milk, which is the only big scare of milk that I know about.
