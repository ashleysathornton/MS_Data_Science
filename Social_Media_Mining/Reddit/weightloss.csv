"It has been a great tool for me.  It has changed my relationship with food.  I've learned that there is a time and place for eating, and that I dont have to reach for food everytime I feel a little bit hungry, which more than likely is me just feeling bored.  I can reach for water instead, I will survive until it is mealtime.  I dont snack while watching TV, I dont absentmindedly reach for food anymore.

"It's worked for me, more effectively than calorie/food tracking. I've been doing IF for about \~7 months now and I've lost over 50 pounds. I probably would have lost more but I've been taking it easy-ish; I have cheat days and my window varies from 4-8 hours a day, depending, but I would definitely recommend IF to anyone looking for a method that works for them.",0.3811,0.125,0.773,0.103
"A lot of people have had great success with it. I’ve read mostly about people using 16:8 working up to 20:4 or even one meal a day (OMAD) 

Unfortunately it seems to depend on your background. If you’ve always been someone who eats over a very long time span throughout the day it’ll probably be great; but for someone like myself who had been a chronic breakfast skipper since middle school, so about 13 years, there’s a more complicated issue of getting metabolism to function properly, so this is where eating 4-6 small meals/100 or so calorie snacks every 2-3 hours is necessary. 

When I say skipping breakfast I mean skipping breakfast and lunch and basically not eating a damn thing until like 7pm. I would be in school from 8-3, in honors and AP classes so I’d work through lunch in the library and then stay after school to work with people on our honors math until at least 6 usually 7 or so at the library. Thinking back now I probably wouldn’t have had to study nearly as much if I wasn’t starving myself all day. 

So my one, and largest meal would be pretty late and likely unhealthy. Both parents worked a lot so it was usually whatever snackage I could put together. My metabolism was so use to this I wouldn’t feel hungry at all and even nauseous if I tried to make myself eat in the morning. 

I started with just getting a string cheese down to take some vitamins with, once I got a job at a movie theater and restaurant I would eat on my lunch break because we had a great and inexpensive kids menu, chicken strips and sweet pot fries. I lost a ton of weight, just by eating... something. It definitely wasn’t healthy though, and now I am working to incorporate frequent healthy snacks in my daily routine. 

I have started being flour and sugar free, following bright line eating (with some missteps) and I have lost about 15lbs in the last 6 weeks.",0.9926,0.16,0.797,0.043
Down 40lbs from switching to Intermittent fasting. It just feels better and natural to me. I don't get hungry through the day. But at 5 (my eating time) I eat a lot. But still keep my weight off. My wife tried and was miserable. It works for me. I hope it works for you too.,0.3071,0.131,0.795,0.074

"i’ve never been able to fast for a full week, that’s just too tough lol. but i’ll go a day or two without consuming any calories.

remember: **zero calorie drinks are still on the table.** diet sodas are probably a bad idea (just in general it’s a good idea to avoid any carbonation at all) but energy/osmosis water drinks like vitamin water zero, or beverages like plain tea without anything added are still on the table.

when fasting for any period of time, remember:

• drink LOTS of water

• take your vitamins!!!

• if you’re going to exercise on the day of, only VERY LIGHT exercise. some stretching and easy yoga is all you really want to do. if you’re fasting for more than 1 day, I wouldn’t recommend anything heavier than stretching daily.

• in the days before (about as many as you plan to fast for) double up on the servings of vegetables. if you’re just doing a single day fast then this isn’t quite as important, but it will make it easier to refuse food for any amount of time.

• avoid salt in the days before

• the day after, eat a lot of protein

• don’t expect to lose a lot of weight from fasting.

**fasting just to lose weight is not a very good idea, and can put you in danger of eating disorders.** the point of intermittent fasting is rather to boost your metabolism, through which it will actually work pretty well! a day or two with no food per month can boost metabolism nicely!

if you’re fasting for longer than that, have at least a full months buffer between fasting periods. if fasting for a full week, maybe only do that 2-3 times a year, to be honest. if you fast for too long too often, the effects will start to fade because your body will get used to having no food, and you could actually start gaining weight easier. 

fasting too often, too long, can ALSO put you at danger for an eating disorder. again, **fasting is not an effective way to lose weight,** and **losing weight should not be your end goal from fasting.**

also, know that fasting isn’t for everyone. i’ve done it a few times thus far (only one day fasts at a time, which is already difficult for me) but it can be really difficult depending on who you are. if you’re someone who deals with a lot of cravings (me too lol) then fasting might not be the best choice for you.

other ways to boost your metabolism are just to exercise, before and after meals. you don’t necessarily have to do heavy cardio daily, some stretching and yoga in the morning before breakfast, a light jog between breakfast and lunch, a brisk walk after lunch, and then squats before and after dinner have been my go-to daily for a while a now, and i’ll schedule some of the heavier exercise around my week. remember to put all those calories you’re consuming day to day to good use!

good luck on your weight loss journey, and happy fasting!",0.981,0.146,0.753,0.101
"I have sugar addiction and impulse control problems (hence the sugar addiction )

I find that IF has helped me to really rethink hunger and provide me with impulse control that I didn’t have before. I’ve been pushing to OMAD (one meal a day) and so far I need a lot less sugar and a lot less food in general. 

I would say what’s helped the most is 
- drinking tons of water 
- getting in salt and electrolytes 
- really pushing to get to that one or two meals a day. I find small pieces of gum or salt tablets help to get me there. 

The secret is to fast and then feast - so you gotta make sure your tummy is really full once you’ve eaten.",0.0056,0.042,0.916,0.042
"IF helps because it’s not a diet, it’s just an eating schedule. I struggle with impulse and getting bored on diets, and I found IF as a valuable way to instill some accountability. The first couple of days are horrible, and if you have an inconsistent schedule (I was a grad student when I started and it was tough), then it’s hard. But I used IF as a way to check myself and as a building block for any diet/additional eating lifestyle I want to try. 

I also did feel much less foggy when I did IF, just some water/black coffee in the morning and I was ready to go. I didn’t workout while doing IF (knee surgery), but just make sure you know your body and don’t go into dangerous levels of deficit while working out. 

I am not an expert by any means so please take all of this with a grain of salt, but I quite like IF and can’t wait to get back into it now that I have a consistent schedule.",0.2445,0.106,0.793,0.101

"It's a fine technique however the more apt description for what most refer to as ""intermittent fasting"" would be ""time-restricted eating"". 16:8 seems to be very popular. 16 hrs of fasting vs. 8 hour eating window. However, be sure to understand that this method only offers another approach to helping someone adhere to a diet and restrict calories. Protein and calories equated other dieting methods (keto, low fat, paleo, etc) yield comparable net fat loss. Adherence is what affected most by dieting strategy.",0.2006,0.104,0.8,0.096
"Intermittent fasting can help some people lose weight just because their eating window is much smaller IE less calories.
Prolonged fasting 24hr+ has added benefits of ketosis, and cellular autophagy.

"A better way of fasting is eat 2000 calories most days and eat 1500 every three days, and exercise on an empty stomach the 1500 cal day, thatway the body burns stored fat.

That 8 on 15 off stuff has been debunked , 2000 calories in a day is 2000 calories the math doesn't change",0.2732,0.054,0.912,0.034
"So, in terms of vodka sodas, vodka still has ~64 calories in it per oz. when you order a drink at a bar, it’s typically anywhere from 1.5 oz to 2 oz, which after two or three drinks adds up. There’s also been studies shown where alcohol forces your body to digest differently, where it will focus on breaking down the alcohol and not the calories, thus storing into fat. I would recommend only drinking on the weekends when in weight loss mode. Get into a habit of watching how much you consume, the recommended amount for women is 7 drinks a week on average, more than that is considered at risk for alcohol abuse, and will lead to weight gain. In terms of your actual diet, what is a typical day of eating for you? More, Smaller, meals lead towards better weight loss from my experience, but it really matters what you are eating. I am doing the intermittent fasting and it’s working well for me. Hope this helps, good luck!",0.9642,0.15,0.81,0.04

"First of all, congrats on your weight loss journey and being motivated to make such changes. Your list of changes you made for experiencing weight loss is fundamentally sound since you don't espouse or do some fad diet or questionable pill or drink that promises quick weight loss. 

The outlined six steps you have incorporated in your lifestyle works for you and can work for others, too. However, since everyone's body is different and varied some tinkering of exact lifestyle changes one has to make for weight loss will vary somewhat from the techniques that work for you. It's interesting that you do intermittent fasting and your body can handle such change. It is form of caloric restriction that can work in other forms also to cause weight loss. You skip meat at dinner and it helps some your GI issues, but some weight loss diet plans do allow proteins in all three meals or the current Keto diet espouses protein and high fat diet for weight loss. I am not big fan of this diet since it has some unforeseen side effects when followed on long term basis. Eating nuts is healthy due its good amounts of protein, some fiber, and healthy fats in them. Also, if you are quite active or very active, staying hydrated with water is needed to keep your body in good working order. For some people that may be six glasses, eight glasses or even ten glasses based their metabolic rate, BMI, foods they eat, and activity level. Checking food labels and staying away from foods with large list of ingredients made up of hard-to-pronounce chemicals does not sound like natural or less processed foods. Finally, staying active helps in the weight loss journey, but is not sufficient for long-term steady weight loss or maintenance without some diet changes. Studies have shown that such changes are only proven and reliable ways to lose weight for anyone who wants to shed that unwanted body weight. 

In conclusion, stay motivated, keep up your weight loss goals, and healthy living for now and into the future. :-)",0.9464,0.132,0.764,0.104
